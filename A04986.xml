            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8638:5"/>Repentance, uſuall in affliction; fourthly, Gods readineſſe to Commiſeration: leading us to conſider herein a double correſpondencie; one, of Gods judgements to mans ſinne; the other, of Gods mercie to mans penitencie. If man ſinne, God ſtriketh; if man repent of his ſinne, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteth from his wrath. This is manifeſted by divers ſtories of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> here for this purpoſe onely touched; but in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Bookes hiſtoricall, they are with their circumſtances farther enlarged. Amongſt the reſt, the Pſalmiſt pointeth at the ſtorie which is recorded, <hi>Num.</hi> 25. Whereupon he obſerveth, firſt, the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſinne, and that in ſpeciall, <hi>Ver.</hi> 28. <hi>They joyned unto Baal Peor, and eate the offerings of the dead;</hi> and in generall, <hi>Ver.</hi> 29. <hi>They provoked God to anger with their owne inventions:</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Gods judgement; <hi>The Plague broke in upon them:</hi> thirdly, The meanes uſed to pacifie God; <hi>Phinees ſtood up and prayed:</hi> fourthly, the effect that this meanes tooke with God; <hi>The Plague ceaſed:</hi> fifthly, The bleſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon <hi>Phinees,</hi> who uſed the meanes; <hi>It was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe, throughout all generations.</hi> All which points are in themſelves fruitfull, and for us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull: but conſidering mine owne ſtrength, your patience, and the time allotted to us both, I ſhall forbeare the ſpecialties of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſinne, and the reward of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees</hi> zeale, and ſpeake to the reſt briefely, and in their order.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> ſinne, as it is here opened in generall, offereth to our conſideration two markes, common to all ſinnes: firſt, they are <hi>our owne inventions;</hi> ſecondly, they <hi>provoke God to anger.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Their owne inventions:</hi> The Hebrew word was ſo anciently, and is now ordinarily tranſlated and fitted unto ſinne. Wicked workes are juſtly tearmed <hi>(ours)</hi> not as if they were not common to the Devil with us, yea, and at firſt learned of the Devil by us; but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, of Gods will revealed in his Word, to be obeyed by the grace of his Spirit; both which are appointed, the one outwardly, the other inwardly, to inſtruct and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8638:5"/>us in thoſe things, which are meet to be obſerved by us. There is no rule of true wiſdome, which is not a Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Gods Word; no true vertue, which is not an effect of Gods Spirit. The firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth:
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he to the <hi>Iewes</hi>) <hi>I have taught you Ordinances and Lawes, keepe them therefore, and doe them; for that is your wiſdome and underſtanding in the ſight of the people, which ſhall heare all theſe Ordinances, and ſhall ſay, onely this people is wiſe, and of underſtanding, and a great Nation.</hi> The ſecond we learne of <hi>Eſay;</hi> who prophecying of Chriſt, out of whoſe full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we all receive Grace for Grace, ſaith:

                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11.2:</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit of God ſhall rest upon him;</hi> the effects of which Spirit, are after ſpecified to be <hi>Wiſdome, Counſell,</hi> and <hi>Fortitude, the feare of the Lord, Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and other Vertues, which make a perfectly good both Man and Governour.

Alſo I ſet Watchmen over you, which ſaid, Take heed to the

               <p>Our ſecond Guide, is Gods Word: wherein many things are neceſſarily concluded, which are not therein literally expreſſed. In matters of Faith and Manners, we are not tyed to the ſtrictneſſe of the Letter, but the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Senſe. Our Saviour Chriſt is our Maſter in this courſe: He proveth the Reſurrection of the Dead,

Let the true Chriſtian conferre the proofes, and for his owne eternall comfort judge, whether they deſerve not the cenſure of Chriſt,

               <p>Another worke there is which muſt bee examined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the World is therewith much perplexed; I meane the Ceremonies and Diſcipline: it muſt be inquired, Whether the obſervance of them be a worke of Gods, or ours. And heere theſe three Rules are of all hands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. Firſt, No Diſcipline or Ceremony muſt be contrary to the Word of God. Secondly, None muſt be equalled thereto. Thirdly, Both muſt edifie us therin. Theſe three Rules being obſerved, I ſay, Firſt, whatſoever thing is in its owne nature indifferent may by lawfull power be limited. Secondly, Being lawfully ſo enjoyned, it muſt be obediently uſed. Thirdly, No Man with a good Conſcience may forgoe his Vocation for this cauſe onely, becauſe he cannot be releaſed from the uſe of ſuch a thing. The reaſon of all is plaine, for the deniall of the firſt takes away the Magiſtrates lawfull power; the deniall of the ſecond argueth ignorance of Chriſtian obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and the third proveth that ſuch mens credit is the meaſure of their care; and they are more wedded to their fancy, then truly zealous of Gods glory. Theſe poynts have beene largely amplified and Fatherly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; but as yet the world will not be ſatisfied; the Church cannot intreate ſo much of her Children, as to be dutifully obeyed. It is thought by too many a meete deliberation, who ſhould yeeld, whether the Fathers which ſtand for that which is well grounded and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully authorized: or the Children which ſtand againſt the Fathers of their Country, and Fathers of the Church. It were meete the foundations were razed before the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8638:8"/>buildings be ruined, and the Reaſons anſwered before the Church be altered. But they have found at leaſt a <hi>Simile</hi> to make good their cauſe. The Church is like mans body. Our Soveraignes new entrie may bee compared to the Spring. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> compariſon is acknowledged; and for our Spring the Lord be bleſſed. But what then? As mans body, ſo the Church this Spring time muſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. An old <hi>Simile</hi> new furbiſhed. For indeed our Church evidences doe tell us of two ſuch Springs within theſe Sixty yeares, beſides a dangerous Autumne that went not long before, in which three ſeaſons the Church hath beene ſo purged, that her loſſe is never like to bee recovered: Yet thoſe Phyſicians were ſo well rewarded, that we doe not wonder if they have left us a ſeede, that would gladly doe us the like ſervice. But we ſhall doe well to know, that there are many bodies that take leaſt Phyſicke, and yet are moſt in health; and ſome humors though peccant ſleepe without diſtemper of the body, which being ſtirred by Phyſicke caſt downe and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger many a ſtrong body. He ſpake wiſely though homely, that compared a Phyſitian to a Laundreſſe: Shee that waſheth whiteſt weareth ſooneſt; and I am ſure it were better for the Church to be ſtill craſie, then ſo often cured. But one Rule of Phyſicke they obſerve well: for the Diet is not ſafely Miniſtred except the body be firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and being ſo earneſtly diſpoſed to Diet us, I cannot but commend their skill, if before-hand they would purge us. But they ſhall deſerve better thanks, if they ſpare their paines in both: the Church needeth Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, rather then Purgations. He (ſaith <hi>Plato</hi>) that will heale running eyes, muſt firſt cure the braine; and the braine is not recovered except the ſtomach be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for theſe have a dependance one upon the other, and a conſent each with the other. The Churches looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is her ſore eyes, or rather a ſore in mens eyes; the Churches ignorance is a defect in her braine, and many complaine, that divers of her ſonnes have too dull and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8638:9"/>flegmaticke a braine: The Churches maintenance, is her Stomacke; but the World will not underſtand, that ſhe hath too cold a Stomacke, that the Source and Spring of her other Diſeaſes ariſes from the coldneſſe of that. Where the Authoritie of the Church is ſo many wayes curbed, and the Portion ſo curtailed, what wonder if the unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are tolerated, and many lewd ones eſcape unpuniſhed? But let the Armes of the Church be unpinnacled, let the Heart of the Church be refreſhed, then the complaint will be more juſt: if her Eyes continue ſore, if her Braine continue cold, then mortifie that Braine, pluck out thoſe Eyes: but if you take a contrarie courſe, beleeve it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſeeme to reſtore for the preſent, you prevent not a worſe diſeaſe. That Chimicall Oyle, though never ſo curiouſly extracted, and in never ſo ſmall quantitie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, is not without reaſon ſuſpected; upon the receit whereof, many men have periſhed: Blame us not, if our Neighbours harmes doe make us to beware. Or if our Humours doe abound, and the world will not beleeve the contrarie, but that the Churches Authoritie is too great, her Livings be too many; the one gives libertie to Sinne, the other breeds neglect of many Soules; deale with us as with Scholars; if we muſt dye, let us dye by the Booke. Aske counſell of Antiquitie, and let our Fathers teach: Learne of them what Phyſicians they uſed, when as they cured the Phyſicians of their Soules. <hi>Moſes</hi> commends the charge of the whole Law unto the King: both firſt and ſecond Table, concerning the Parſons, Prieſts, and People, were diſpoſed and ordered by the appointment of the King: But the King did not proceed herein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counſell. Reade the ſtorie of <hi>Jehoſaphat, Joaſh,</hi> and <hi>Ezechias,</hi> (all good Kings) and there you ſhall find who in theſe caſes, were the Kings directors: The advice and execution was the Prieſts, the command and power was the Kings.

There remaines onely <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which we doe not denie to others, and others muſt yeeld it unto us. In theſe things we ſhould not prejudice one the other, but reſerre our ſelves both to God, who is the unpartiall Iudge of both. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is my Author. <hi>Iudge nothing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before the time,

Are there no Drunkards, Adulterers, common Barreters, but of the Church? Or is their exceſſe in theſe ſinnes growne ſo extraordinarie, that they cannot be repreſſed by the Cenſures of their Ordinarie? Is Suſpenſion, Deprivation, Degradation, no paine? But the Miniſter muſt be tryed by God and his Countrey? Or will the diligence of the Civill Sword make amends for the negligence of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Cenſure? I will not particularize ſuch crying ſinnes as reigne amongſt us: and yet the Civill Sword authorized thereunto, is ſlow enough to root them out;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8638:10"/>nay, it is, if not the breeder, yet the a better of ſome of them: a thing not obſerved, and therefore not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied. Therefore, let us both remember the Apoſtles Rule,

                  <hi>We know the Law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully,</hi> Your Law is good, and ours is good; but we are both ſick of one diſeaſe, wee have not ſo much grace as wee ſhould have, to uſe it lawfully: Wee ſhould therefore pray one for another, amend one the other, and beare one with the other.

But if the Bill began, <hi>Si Pop.

This was a popular, but a peſtilent counſell; farre be it from all Chriſtians either to approve or practiſe it. Let us not bind heavie burthens, to lay on Miniſters ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which the better ſort of Commons will be loth to lift with the leaſt of their fingers: diſtinguiſh our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from our Vocations; and let the meaneſt of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſare the better, for the greatneſſe of our Vocations. The time was, when the lower Clergie was reckoned in place next to the Peeres; let it not downe ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as to range it with the meaneſt of the Commons.

               <p>The word (provoked) is applied indifferently both to God, and Man; but the thing muſt bee conceived to bee otherwiſe in God then in Man, whether wee reſpect the cauſe, the nature, or the manner of it. 1 The cauſe moving anger in Man is not alwayes ſinne, but ſometimes vertue; and that not onely in wicked Men, but alſo in the beſt. <hi>Moſes</hi> was angry with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, <hi>Ionas</hi> with the mercy of God, <hi>Iob</hi> with the triall of God; but nothing can ſtirre anger in God, but onely ſinne.

<note n="h" place="margin">

What then is anger in God? Wee muſt thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. As ſinne is contrarie to Gods holineſſe, ſo is it proceeded againſt, by Gods juſtice. The diſlike that Gods holineſſe takes againſt ſinne, is called his <hi>hatred;</hi> and the proceſſe of his juſtice, is called his <hi>wrath:</hi> And that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe may be conſidered, either as by Gods Miniſters it is threatned, and ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it,

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods revealed Wrath:</hi> or, as by Gods powerfull hand it is executed; in which ſenſe, the Scripture remembreth us of <hi>a
<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5.</note> Day of Wrath.</hi> When men are ſaid to provoke Gods wrath, the meaning is, that what Gods Miniſters in his Name have threatned, that ſame puniſhment by Gods power is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon irrepentant godleſſe men. And in this ſenſe muſt we take the phraſe in this place, and learne there-out to imitate God: not to be offended, but with evill; not to be offended, before we be provoked with evill; not to paſſe a meane, when wee have a juſt cauſe to be offended with thoſe that are evill: an imitation fit for the beſt men, ſeeing the defect thereof hath beene an imperfection even in the worthieſt men. And thus much of the ſecond marke of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Now couple theſe two together, and obſerve in a word the viperouſneſſe of ſinne; ſo naturall, ſo unnaturall unto us. It is unto us both our brood, and bane: like the Devil himſelfe, who is a Serpent, and a Satan; cunning to ſeduce us, malicious to accuſe us. Our owne ſinnes inſnare us, our owne ſinnes ſeparate betweene God and us, our owne ſinnes teſtifie againſt us, our owne ſinnes are a deſtruction unto us. And therefore, we have good reaſon to hearken to Saint <hi>Peter:
<note n="l" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11.</note> I beſeech you, brethren, as ſtrangers and

               <p>I come to the ſecond point, which is Gods judgement, contained in theſe words, <hi>The Plague brake out upon them.</hi> The word <hi>Plague,</hi> is ſtreitned, in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, and commonly referred onely to the Peſtilence: but in other Languages it reacheth farther, and notes any extraordinarie ſtroake that comes from God. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets under that word, containe theſe foure, <hi>Famine, Peſtilence, wild Beaſts,</hi> and <hi>the Sword;</hi> which by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, are called the foure Plagues of God: Not that God doth not create all, both

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8638:13"/>our confeſſion; whileſt that puniſhing Angel ſtirreth, we ſtand all at the mercy of God. Some learned men are of opinion, that a <hi>Peſtilence</hi> waſting many of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> was a part of that <hi>Plague,</hi> wherewith God is ſaid here to have ſtricken them; but becauſe the proofe is not pregnant, we will not further purſue it: Of this we are ſure, that, that which is evident, is equivalent; for in one day, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes ſoever they died 24000. were deſtroyed. But come we to the ſecond part of this note, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>This Plague brake out upon them;</hi> Onely remember that the heavier Gods judgement lighteth upon us, the louder he calls for repentance unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plague brake out upon them.</hi>] The word hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſignifications, which hath cauſed many interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               <p>Againe, in this <hi>breaking out of the Plague,</hi> we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, not onely that Mercie ſometimes gives place to Iuſtice, but alſo the unreſiſtableneſſe of Iuſtice, when it comes, it beares downe all before it.

               <p>Laſtly, here wee may obſerve the correſpondence of Gods juſtice to mans ſinne: the ſame word is applyed to both; to man ſinning, to God ſtriking; both of them <gap reason="foreign">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if we will that God ſet bounds to his wrath, we muſt keepe within the bounds of our owne dutie.</p>
               <p>Some reſpect not ſo much the <hi>violence,</hi> as the <hi>varietie</hi> of the Plague, and tranſlate it, <hi>The Plague was multiplyed.</hi> Firſt, as the Sinne, ſo the Plague was manifold. They fell ſpiritually, and corporally; by Idolatrie, and Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie: therefore, their Plague was not of one ſort; ſome were hanged, ſome were ſtabbed, and ſome conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Peſtilence.

               <p>I haſten to the third point, which containes the meanes to pacifie God; <hi>Phinees ſtood up and prayed: Phinees,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Aaron,</hi> a Prieſt by birth and function; the neerer he was to God, the more zealous he was for the glory of God. <hi>Levi</hi> had this teſtimonie of <hi>Moſes:
<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.9.</note> He ſaid to his Father and Mother, I regard you not; to his Brethren, I acknowledge you not; and to his Children, I know you not, that he might obſerve the Law of God, and keepe his Covenant.</hi> Here, a ſonne of <hi>Levi</hi> hath this teſtimonie from God, that he was <hi>zealous for his glory,</hi> and <hi>pacified his wrath:</hi> for both hee is commended, and plentifully rewarded. A good example for ſuch as have the like charge, to ſtirre them up to the like zeale. And God grant we may doe ſo with God, that God may deale ſo with us, and with our ſeed for ever.</p>
               <p>But the fact of <hi>Phinehas</hi> hath ſomething extraordinarie. <hi>[He ſtood up.]</hi> Being a private man, and a Prieſt, he uſed the Sword: ſo ſome obſerve; but that hee was a private man, is not ſo true. Beſides the High Prieſt, there were other chiefe Prieſts, which had charge of many both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things; the Bookes of <hi>Numbers, Chronicles,</hi> and the Goſpel, cleare this point: And that Gods pleaſure was, that the Prieſts ſhould ſometimes uſe the Sword, it is plaine, by the examples of <hi>Eli, Samuel,</hi> and the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi> Iudges and reformers of the Common-wealth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the two firſt, expreſſely thereunto called of God; and the thirds lawfull power may be argued, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8638:14"/>bleſſings it was accompanied with from God. But this was in defect of Civill Power, which ordinarily by Gods appointment beares the Sword; and we muſt be well warranted, before ſuch examples be imitated: when there is a Civill Governour, the Prieſt can have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to uſurpe the Authoritie of the Governour. The greater is the ſinne of the B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath combined ſo great a Sword with ſo great a Key, and executeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly zeale with unjuſt power. But <hi>Phinees</hi> his caſe is not ſuch. God beares witneſſe to his zeale, and approves his fact: his zeale was diſcernable onely of God; but the fact excuſable in the judgement of men, not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable by the witneſſe of God. For againſt the ſinne, God had pronounced death, <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſpecified the kind of death; they were backward, that ſhould have executed the Sentence: but rather then God ſhould be openly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, the Magiſtrates charge not obeyed, <hi>up ſtood Phinees,</hi> and by him the parties were executed. So that <hi>Phinees</hi> did debaſe himſelfe to be an Executioner, rather then exalt himſelfe as an Vſurper; he leveld his action, by Gods and <hi>Moſes</hi> his former direction: which I obſerve the rather, becauſe ſome too farre amplifie the irregularitie of <hi>Phinees</hi> his fact; and ſome are too forward, upon warrant of this Example, to uſurpe the Magiſtrates Sword: but neither find good ground to build upon, in this Hiſtorie.</p>
               <p>I goe on: <hi>Phinehas ſtood up and prayed.</hi> The word hath divers ſignifications, and they have bred divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations among both ancient and later Divines. The Tranſlations are three: The <hi>Septuagint,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> neither is it improbable: for it is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Creed, that the <hi>Maſoreth</hi> containes all various Lections; yea, there are ſtrong preſumptions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. Thoſe that are later then either the <hi>Septuagint</hi> or <hi>Chalde,</hi> and whoſe Maſters I ſuppoſe were worſe, tranſlate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8638:15"/>it <hi>(He executed judgement,)</hi> whoſe ground is the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Verbe, enforcing, as they thinke, this for the fitteſt ſignification. But it cannot be juſtified, that this is the onely ſignification of that Conjugation; and the places alledged, may make it to be doubted, whether at all this be the ſignification.

A ſight on the one ſide abominable, on the other honourable.

Behold here one, and that a great one, <hi>Zimri</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Salu,</hi> a Prince of the Tribe of <hi>Simeon.</hi> When in a like caſe, <hi>Ieremie</hi> had preached in vaine, he turnes to God with this ſpeech: <hi>O Lord,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5.</note> are not thine eyes upon the Truth; thou haſt ſmitten them, but they have not ſorrowed; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction; they have made their faces harder then a ſtone, and have refuſed to returne. Therefore I ſaid, Surely, thoſe to whom I have hitherto preached, are but poore men, and ſimple ones, which know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgement of their God. I will get me to the great men, and ſpeake to them; they are learned in the way of the Lord, and in the judgement of their God.</hi> But what he found, he reports: <hi>Thoſe great men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſonnes of Belial; they have broken the yoke, and burſt Gods bands.</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8638:18"/>Majeſty, ſhall find to his ruine that it is an incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible myſtery. I have therefore choſen this Scripture, which reſpecteth the ſeaſon, and yet exceeds not our ſtrength, in the meditation whereof we need not hazard our weak ſight, to behold the body of the Sun ſhining in his ſtrength above in the firmament, but may refreſh it in the beames thereof ſweetly tempered to our uſe on the face of this earth. Here we may ſee, that there are three <hi>perſons in God;</hi> and alſo that which we ſhould moſt deſire to ſee, how all three concurre to doe us good. The Holy Spirit teacheth us to pray to God the Father, who embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us with love manifeſted in that eternall life, which we ſhall enjoy at the comming of our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Now although we muſt ſtay by the poſſeſſion of this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, till the day of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet muſt we ſecure our title thereunto in the dayes of our fleſh. And how muſt wee ſecure that? Surely by thoſe vertues, wherewith God doth fence his Church againſt the deluge of thoſe vices that overflow the world. The Church and the world are diſtinct ſocieties, and therefore ſhould be of different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. Vpon this ground, the maine drift of this Epiſtle is to teach us that wee may not conforme our ſelves to them, from whom we are ſevered by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yea in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular my text perſwades, that conſidering the continuall and woefull revolting of counterfeit beleevers and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt livers, as many as are true members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ordained to continue the ſucceſſion of the Church, ought the more to proceed in grace, and more and more apply themſelves to the fountaine of grace. 1.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8638:18"/>Chriſt unto eternall life.</hi> You ſee then that the argument of this Scripture is a Chriſtian care, whereof there are two indeavours: to profit, and perſevere, in grace and in the love of God, and in theſe we are ſuſtained by two bleſſed meanes, helpe and hope; Helpe from the holy ſpirit, and hope in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let us reſume theſe points, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them briefly in order.</p>

To note this, the meaſure of the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> were proportioned to the body of a man in the old Teſtament; and in the new the reſemblance is unfolded by <hi>Chriſt.

                  </label> whether that coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcription thereof, which out of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> and other Architects Mathematicall principles, <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> and <hi>Dradus</hi> have lately made, be as true, as it is learned, as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious as it is painefull. But to the purpoſe. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this abſolute holineſſe of the matter of GODS word made the <hi>Iewes</hi> to conceive carnally of the worſhip of God, and of the kingdome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> dreaming that the firſt had no more in it, then the ceremonie, and that the ſecond conſiſted in worldly pompe and glory. And the now Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſlipt into both theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Their ſuperfluous, and ſuperſtitious rites have, at leaſt in practiſe, not only darkned, but even aboliſhed many in heavenly truth; and inſteed of an eccleſiaſticall hierarchie provided for the quiet and decent ordering of the Church, they have forged a terreſtriall monarchie to the bane of both Church and Common-wealth. Our leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therefore muſt be, that howſoever the things of God are expreſſed in phraſes fitting the capacity of men; yet wee give them no earthly tincture; for ſo they will ceaſe to be fit matter of the moſt holy faith of a Chriſtian man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the matter is moſt holy, ſo is the Author too; for hee is God, and not man. Betweene God and man,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8638:20"/>there is this difference;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 34.</note> that <hi>God is truth, and every man a lyar.</hi> Every man, if but a meere man, may deceive, or be deceived; but neither of theſe are incident to God, <hi>neque; actu neque; potentiâ.</hi> God doth not, he cannot lye; God is not, he cannot be deceived. Therefore the higheſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a good man is, that hee ſpeakes in <hi>veritate mentis,</hi> without ſimulation, or diſſimulation; without equivocation or mentall reſervation; the praiſe due to God is, that he ſpeakes in <hi>certitudine veritatis:</hi> his word muſt ſtand,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.7.</note> it is tried to the uttermoſt, <hi>it is as ſilver tried ſeven times in the fire.</hi> There is no terreſtreitie in him; we may ſecurely truſt him, Vpon this ground it is agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That, that whereon our faith muſt finally reſolve, is Gods Word. Secondly, That, what this word is, we muſt receive from the Church. Thirdly, That the Church hath no power introductory, but declaratory. Fourthly, That, in this declaratory power the Church proceeds not by immediate revelation, but by ratiocination, if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>verbum ſcriptum</hi> (and for <hi>verbum non ſcriptum</hi> which they obtrude to be a ſucceſſive tradition even from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> it is a forgery of their owne braine.) Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That in the ratiocination wee muſt proceed by two meanes, Analogy, and Antiquity. Sixthly, That, Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie is, either of the faith, comprehended in the ancient Catechiſme ever taught in the Church, and gathered out of evident places of Scripture, and it comprehends the firſt and undeniable principles of faith; or of the Text, by the coherence of <hi>antecedentia</hi> and <hi>conſequentia,</hi> by the proprietie of the phraſe, and Seventhly, That antiquity is, the deciſion of counſels, or commentaries of Fathers agreeing betweene themſelves and delivering the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the Church in their times. Eightly, That in the uſing of theſe meanes, the Church hath a promiſe, that Gods ſpirit will direct it, not ſimply, but if it bee aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the feare of God, without prejudice, or partiality of faction;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Where two or three be gathered together, in my
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8638:20"/>Name,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I am in the midſt of them:</hi> ſo that they cannot erre damnably, or miſleade the people. This we ſay; and yet they ſay we build on private ſpirits. We denie not private ſpirits diſcretion, but theſe are the grounds of our definition. And here we begin to differ. Firſt, That the bleſſing in uſing of theſe meanes we ſay is common to every particular Church; they reſtraine it to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> calling that the Catholike Church which we deny. Secondly, They take away infallibility from the body of their Church, yea of the whole Church; and give it to the Pope, contrary to their owne councels before <hi>Luther;</hi> that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which placed it in the Catholike Church. Thirdly, They hold it not impoſſible even for this head of their Church, to be an Hereticke; but that he ſhould teach Hereſie, they ſay it is impoſſible: As if <hi>Ne fides tua deficiat</hi> in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, had that ſenſe; to ſay nothing of his common impiety, impurity, and iniquity which they confeſſe alſo. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They ſay he may teach Hereſie, but not in <hi>Cathedra. Extra</hi> he may do it, ſo he doe it as a private Doctor; yea and print it too, at leaſt write it. Fifthly, In <hi>Cathedra</hi> the Antecedents or premiſſes he may miſtake, though hee take them out of the Scripture, but the concluſion is cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Sixthly, The very concluſion, if he doe not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it as a matter of faith but probability, may be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous too. Behold how certaine they are, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine we of our faith: and how wee build upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpirits, but they upon a rock; Surely howſoever we eſcape, too many of them make ſhipwracke. I preſſe this the rather, becauſe there is not any thing wherein the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates of that Sea do more now a dayes inſult then this. But to leave them to their failing and wounding reed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> let us build upon GODS Word, whoſe ſenſe we may ſearch out by ſuch meanes as have beene alwaies ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As our <hi>Faith is moſt holy</hi> in regard of Gods Word, ſo is it no leſſe in regard of our beliefe therein. For
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8638:21"/>as the object deſcendeth from heaven; ſo muſt we aſcend unto heaven. But we muſt diſtinguiſh two faculties in our ſoule, anſwerable to the two points of the object. There is in the object the matter of Gods Word, and the Author: in regard of the matter it is <hi>bonum;</hi> in regard of the Author, <hi>Verum.</hi> Now our faith muſt anſwerably beleeve it, firſt as <hi>verum,</hi> which is, <hi>aſſenſus mentis,</hi> and then as <hi>bonum</hi> which is <hi>aſſenſus cordis.</hi> Our witt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our will; our underſtanding and our affection, muſt both be holy, that is, lifted up above the earth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our underſtanding muſt be holy: for we muſt beleeve God abſolutely; and it is the firſt Article of our Creed, <hi>I beleeve in God the Father Almighty;</hi> which clauſe goeth through all the Articles of Creed. God is Almighty to create, to redeeme, to judge, to forgive, to give both grace and glory.

                  </gap>, hanging betweene heaven and earth, but reſolute, that whatſoever God ſaith is true. Yet wee muſt note, that the immediate object of our faith is not Gods power, but his revealed will, though we relie upon his revealed will, as it is ſecured by his Almighty power. So that all the arguments for Tranſubſtantiation, that reaſon from Gods power, touch us not, who denie it becauſe there is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for it in Gods revealed will. <hi>Conſtet de voluntate;</hi> let it appeare that God would have it ſo; and let us goe for infidels if we denie it to be ſo. But finding nothing for it in Gods revealed will, we argue againſt it as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, not <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> but <hi>exhypotheſi.</hi> And ſo affirmatively we give reaſons of that which is revealed; as, of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, Aſcention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the revealed will of God there are two things. <hi>Verbumrei,</hi> the word; and <hi>res verbi,</hi> the myſtery. Our faith builds it ſelfe immediately upon the former, not upon the latter; See then the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that withdraw the Scriptures from the people, becauſe they are hard. They ſay true, if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8638:21"/>you looke to <hi>rem verbi,</hi> the myſtery; but if you looke to <hi>verbum rei,</hi> the word; it is not ſo. As for example, the Scripture teacheth that there is one God in three perſons; the words are plaine and eaſie, every man heares, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands them; but the myſtery contained in theſe words doth paſſe the reach of a man: and in this reſpect it is true, that <hi>ſides melius definitur per ignorantiam, quàm per notitiam;</hi> and Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves it to have beene the common ſaying of his time, <hi>accepto baptiſmo, dicimus fidelis factus ſum, credo quod neſcio:</hi> and finally S. <hi>Hilaries</hi> rule is true. <hi>Habet non tam veniam, quam praemium ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quod credas.</hi> So then the hardneſſe of the matter is no juſt reaſon to debarre the people from reading the words; eſpecially if they bee kept from giving them any other ſenſe then may ſtand with the elements of Religion deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Catechiſine; for then though they may in reading miſtake the true ſenſe, or analogy of the place, yet they cannot damnably erre againſt the Creed, or ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of faith. But it is too true, that many take too great liberty againſt thoſe ſober bounds which are ſet them by our Church; every Pariſh Church almoſt having their private Catechiſme of private draught, not of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call preſcript; which fils the ignorant with more reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then are ſound, and gives occaſion to force many paſſages of Scripture to that ſenſe. It were to be wiſhed, that to avoid ſcandall, and to prevent further danger, at leaſt publikely, no other principles might be taught or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, then the Church hath allowed, and are without exception; that the whole Church ſuſtaine not the juſt blame, that is occaſioned by ſome irregular members ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And let this ſerve for the lifting up of our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings above the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our will alſo muſt be lift up; it muſt not be <hi>earthly,</hi> but <hi>holy.</hi> For the object is not only <hi>Verum,</hi> true; but alſo <hi>bonum</hi> good. And <hi>bonum</hi> is the proper object of the will, as <hi>Verum</hi> is of the underſtanding. It is much diſputed and not yet agreed, whether faith be ſeated in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8638:22"/>the underſtanding or in the will: the opinion moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Scripture is that which placeth it in both: and it is grounded upon this evidence, that in Gods word (as even now I obſerved) there is <hi>verbum rei,</hi> and <hi>res ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi.</hi> The underſtanding begins, and laies hold upon <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum rei,</hi> aſſenting to it; but the heart openeth it ſelfe, and deſireth <hi>rem verbi,</hi> to be partaker of it; for we doe not only aſſent unto the word that it is true, but long after it, as a Soveraigne good. This you may perceive by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> deſcription of faith,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1</note> wherein there is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to things hoped for: but the words rather reſpect the ſeverall faculties of our ſoule, then the quality of thoſe things that are the object of theſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and ſo you may learne by the words of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

And finally, by Faith it comes to paſſe, that Gods Commandements are not grievous unto us: We are not like that man that went away heavie,
<note place="margin">

But I hope none of us have, I could wiſh none of us had ſo learned Chriſt; though it is true, that the life of very many of us ſavoureth little of a <hi>moſt holy Faith.</hi>

               <p>You ſee the Grace is moſt heavenly, and our proprietie therein moſt comfortable; but we have it not all at once, we riſe by many degrees: therefore we are willed not onely to build, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to build upon. The phraſe doth containe a double ſenſe; either that we muſt reſt our ſelves upon our Faith, or that we muſt goe on in Faith. The firſt implyes a compariſon betwixt Faith and other Vertues, whereon we cannot ſo ſecurely build, as we may on Faith: for, Faith correlatively underſtood, as in this argument it is, doth comprehend Chriſt; in which ſenſe, we ſay we are <hi>ſaved by Faith,</hi> that is, by Chriſt, layd hold on by Faith; and ſo to build on Faith, is to build on Chriſt: and Chriſt is the Rock, whereon is built the Church;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4: <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18.</note> as the Fathers out of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> expound that of Saint <hi>Matthew:</hi> Yea, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and the <hi>Chiefe Corner Stone.</hi>

It is true, that no man can procreate himſelfe, or quicken himſelfe, being dead; but being procreated and quickened, he can feed and encreaſe himſelfe. As it is in Nature, ſo in Grace: no man can give himſelfe a ſpiritual being, or repaire it, if it be loſt; but having received it, he is to cheriſh it, and to proceed therein.

               <p>This Talking Age is much troubled with an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Whether a juſtified man may fall wholly from Grace, and whether he may fall finally: I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute either; my Text leads me, to warne you not to fall: onely theſe two points let me obſerve. Firſt, The leaſt ſhrinking from God, ſhould be very grievous to a true Child of God. <hi>David</hi> bemoaned his abſence from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Arke; but marke upon what grounds: <hi>O Lord of Hoſtes,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.1.</note> how amiable are thy Tabernacles! my ſoule longeth, yea, and fainteth, &amp;c.</hi> You ſee, that the ſenſe he had of the ſweetneſſe of the favour of God, made him bemoane him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that was baniſht from the Tabernacle of God: how much more ſhould he have bemoaned himſelfe, if God had forſaken his perſon, that it ſhould no longer be the Houſe of God? Secondly, <hi>Nemo repente fuit turpiſſimus,</hi> God departeth from this our Temple, or us rather, his Temple, as he departed from the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem; Ezechiel</hi> ſhewes how: Firſt, he roſe, and went from betweene the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> and from the <hi>Mercie-Seat,</hi> that is, out of the moſt Holy Place; then reſted a while in the ſecond Roome, which was the Holy Place; then came he neerer <hi>Altare Holocauſti,</hi> and then tooke his flight. The parts of man moſt aptly reſemble theſe parts of the Temple of God: Our Heart is <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> where Chriſt dwells as in his proper place; and the firſt Grace that failes us, is a good Conſcience: Yet men may retaine the knowledge of God, and be able to retaine good
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8638:26"/>from evill, as ſhee did — <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ideo meliora proboque, Deteriora ſequor</hi> — But continuance in ſinne, will even darken the Principles of Truth; and men may be ſo obdurate, as to oppoſe themſelves againſt Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: Then is God driven into the Court, the open Court, where men in policie, and for worldly reſpects, conforme themſelves to that which they neither love nor beleeve. I will be no mans judge, but I would to God we would every man judge himſelfe, and conſider how farre he is gone from God. I doubt, he will be found in more mens heads, then in their hearts; and yet more in mens faces, then in their heads. I would to God, there were not infinite, that have ſet their faces againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp;c. I conclude this point with that of Saint <hi>Paul:

                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6.</note> Chriſt is as the Sonne over his owne Houſe, whoſe Houſehold we are, if we hold faſt that confidence, and that rejoycing of hope to the end. Take heed therefore, Brethren,

               <p>Looking for the mercie. &amp;c.] We have hitherto been kept to our worke, but now are we come to our wages, great wages for ſo little worke; for doeing our duty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall felicity. The compariſon is very uneven. <hi>I am perſwaded</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, that the afflictions of this life,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</note> are not worthy of the glory that ſhall be reveiled. And our light afflictions which are but for a moment,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</note> worke for us a farre more excellent and eternall weight of glory.</hi> But God
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8638:28"/>knowes we have an envious eye, when we ſee the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of wicked men in this world,

               <p>But that life is to be obtained of mercie, <hi>looking for the mercie of our Lord.</hi> &amp;c.

Two things then wee muſt heed; that we ſet not our eyes upon the dignity of our owne perſon, or merit of our owne worke; but cloth our ſelves with Chriſts perſon, that wee may have an intereſt in his meritorious worke. Let us ſet Chriſt alwayes before us, and his ſpirit ſhall be at our right hand ſo that wee ſhall not ſlide; ſo that our heart may be glad, and our tongue reioyce, our fleſh alſo may reſt in hope; for in due time he will ſhew us the pathes of life, <hi>in whoſe preſence is fulneſſe of ioy, and at his right hand pleaſures for evermore.</hi>

               <p>We ſee three perſons in God, and three vertues of a man. Man is as it were the center of all bleſſings that come from every of the three perſons in God; and God muſt be the center wherein muſt end all the three vertues

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Kingdome of God ſhould be taken away from the Iewes, and given unto the Gentiles, our Saviour Chriſt while Hee was on the Earth, taught often times both in word and deed. Of ſuch deeds this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is one, which is the Argument of my Text. Of which there is to be conſidered the occaſion, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8638:30"/>the matter: the occaſion is double; given by the Iewes, taken by Chriſt. The matter repreſenteth two excellent vertues, the one in Chriſt, the other in a Woman of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. Of which vertues we are to conſider the conflict and the ſucceſſe. The conflict ſhewes how both Chriſt and the Woman did by degrees ariſe: the Woman in her importunate faith in Chriſt, Chriſt in his profitable delay to helpe her; and the ſucceſſe ſhewes how both vertues proved to Chriſts great glory, and the Womans great comfort. The Womans faith would not be ſaid nay, and at laſt it ſped well; not onely to her Daughters recovery, but alſo to the high commendations of her faith. Chriſt ſhewes, that what He deferres He doth not deny, but then yeelds when it is moſt fit, both for Him, and alſo for us. This is the ſubſtance of the Hiſtory. Let us reſume the parts, and firſt the Occaſion: the occaſion which (I told you) is firſt given, then taken. Given by the lewes. Chriſt had Preached long amongſt them, and wrought many Miracles; but they were little the better, either in their Faith, or in their Life: though they were His owne, yet <hi>His owne received Him not.</hi> Chriſt therefore went thence; to teach us, that though Chriſt be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obſerver of His promiſe, yet is He a free Diſpoſer of His Grace: He breakes with none, and He is bound to none: if we ſet light by His guifts, we ſhall be quickly rid of Him. The Scripture hath divers examples and Similies to this purpoſe. The example of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when God left <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where God had planted His <hi>Arke,</hi> which <hi>Ieremy</hi> obſerves,

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8638:30"/>three yeares husbandry continuing barren, the Owner thereof commanded to be cut downe. The ſimilitude of the Shepheard, who when He could do no good with His Flocke, brake both His Staves; the Staffe of Beauty, and the Staffe of Bandes; He left them to ſtray and to be ſlaine. The Apoſtles Rule is ſhort, <hi>qui ſtat, videat ne cadat.</hi> If we preſume upon <hi>Templum Domini, Templum Domini,</hi> as did the Iewes; we ſhall find, that God will not ſticke to profane His Temple by forſaking it, if we do not ſticke to prophane that Temple by defiling it. We have no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to breake with God, and yet to be bold, that God will not breake with us. He will not begin to forſake us; but if we go from Him, He will not much deſire to continue with us. Chriſt went thence, but whither did He go? unto the parts of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi> The lewes gave the occaſion; Chriſt taketh it, to go from the Iewes to the Gentiles; to relate the infidelity of the Iew by the faith of the Gentile. For what He ſaid elſewhere, woe be to thee <hi>Chorazin,</hi> woe be to thee <hi>Bethſaida; for if the miracles that have beene done in thee had beene done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have long ſince repented in ſackcloth and aſhes:</hi> Of the truth thereof Chriſt giveth them a taſt in this Hiſtory. And this hath beene an ancient practiſe of God, when the meanes of grace hath profited little within the Church, to confound His people by their readineſſe to believe, that were without the Church. So did He in the dayes of <hi>Eliah</hi> confound <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> a Woman of <hi>Sidon</hi> who entertained the Prophet, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> perſecuted him. And in the dayes of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> by <hi>Naaman</hi> the Aſſyrian, who upon a little taſt of Gods mercy in curing his Leproſie, vowed to ſerve no other God, but the God of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> wheras greater Miracles, and ſundry Sermons wrought and ſpoken by <hi>Elizeus,</hi> could not obtaine ſo much Piety of the <hi>Jſraelites.</hi> The very like is to be obſerved in the ſtory of <hi>Ninivy,</hi> the great City. <hi>Ninivy</hi> (as the Prophet calleth it) was in three dayes Preaching reclaimed by <hi>Ionah,</hi> which laboured
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8638:31"/>many yeares with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and laboured in vaine. God in the ſecond of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſets downe for a Rule in Generall,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eze.</hi> 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Sonne of man, I doe not ſend thee to a Nation that underſtands not thy language;</hi> but if I did, they would heare: whereas this people underſtands, but will not be reformed. Wherefore God (as He threatned in the 32. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>)
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deu.</hi> 32.21.</note> did provoke His people juſtly by them that are no people, a fooliſh nation; as His people provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked their God by them that were no gods, but the work of their owne hands. Chriſt is found of them that ſought Him not, and made manifeſt unto them that enquired not after Him.

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. This was the Iewes caſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaith, that we muſt every one of us make it our caſe: for as God left the Iewes to go to the Gentiles, ſo may He go from us to the Indies; for <hi>ſpiritus ſpirat ubi vult,</hi> and <hi>there is nothing</hi> (as it was ſhewed unto Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the Viſion) <hi>that is uncleane, when God is pleaſed to ſanctifie it.</hi> Chriſt went out of the Coaſts of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi> Thus much of the occaſion. Come to the Hiſtory, which repreſents two eminent vertues, of which vertues we are to conſider, firſt the conflict, the conflict betweene two perſons, which addes ſome right unto the vertues: for what are the vertues? the one is an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Faith, and in whom is that? in a Canaanitiſh woman, an Heathen woman, but (which is more) ſprang from curſed <hi>Cham,</hi> and (which is yet further to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) being of that Line which was ſpecially to be odious to the Iewes, whom they were to roote out without all mercy: that ſuch a woman ſhould beleeve in Chriſt, who was no Iew, by birth, this makes her Fact more memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But what is the other vertue? It is delay, though it proved profitable delay: and in whom was this? It was in our Saviour Chriſt; who if He had beene onely God, it had beene no wonder, if He did put off ſinners in the holineſſe of a Lord; or if it had beene at his ſecond comming in glory, it would not have beene ſtrange, if he had rejected the woman in the auſterity of a Iudge; but to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8638:31"/>doe it in the nature of man, which hee undertooke (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh) that he might be tender hearted towards man; to doe it when he came not to judge, but ſave: for ſuch a perſon, at ſuch a time, to uſe ſuch delay, ſo to reject a poore woman, maketh the vertue of Chriſt the more remarkable, the more admirable. But let us come to the conſlict of theſe vertues. The woman begins and ſets upon Chriſt: She cryed and ſaid, <hi>Have mercy on me ô Lord, thou Sonne of David, my daughter is miſerably vexed with a Devill:</hi> her caſe was bad, and therefore needs the leſſe wonder, if in her ſuit ſhe were ſo earneſt: ſhe ſpake for her child; her child was now left to the malice of the Devill: nothing in nature could be nearer then her child; no corporeall evill could befall it worſe, than to be within the power of the devill: ſuch a caſe would melt a ſtony heart; what wonder if it worke ſo upon the tender heart of a mother? But the meaning of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is, that we ſhould be earneſt in our prayers, according to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our eſtate: the more our danger, the more our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe; and we ſhould preſſe the more upon God, the more we are occaſioned by calamities that are layed upon us by him: for therefore doth he humble us, to warme our cold devotion. It is ſo in diſtreſſes corporall; but much more in our diſtreſſes ſpirituall: we muſt learne the one by this woman, and the other by expreſſing the ſenſe that we have of the want of grace; farre more painefull then the other ſenſe is, of the want of health. But let us heare the womans firſt onſet. She makes a ſhort petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it containes a moſt excellent confeſſion, if you looke to the matter; yea and a moſt confident profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if you looke to the manner of thoſe words wherein ſhe ſpeakes to Chriſt. The matter is a ſhort, but a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the perſon and office of Chriſt. His perſon, he was God and man; ſhe acknowledgeth both: God, in calling Him Lord; for that word muſt not be underſtood but according to the ſtyle of the Scripture, which in ſtead of <hi>Iehovah</hi> in the Hebrew, and in the Greek, ſignifies not a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8638:32"/>bare Lord, but the abſolute Lord both of Heaven and Earth: Shee could not conceave leſſe of Chriſt, when ſhe deſired he would ſhew His power over the Devill; for how could he have power over the Devill, that was not Lord Paramount over all the world? She acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth him then to be God. And to be man alſo, for ſhe calleth him the ſonne of <hi>David.</hi> Which implies not only that he was a man, but alſo the Meſſias, <hi>eodem ipſo Chriſtum Domini:</hi> for as <hi>David</hi> was the Annoninted King of the Lord, ſo was hee the type of Chriſt, that was to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with the <hi>Holy Choſt.</hi> Hee was then a man, and (which is more) he was that man, even the man whom the <hi>Iewes</hi> looked for, to have for their Meſſias. A faire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Chriſts perſon, which further intimates his office too: for he that was Chriſt, was alſo to be Ieſus, He was to ſave, and ſo to ſhew mercy: his office was to be the Mercy-ſeat of God; the reliever of the diſtreſſes of wretched man. Thus much ſhe confeſſeth of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of his office. Yea ſhe profeſſeth it alſo. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many <hi>Jewes</hi> believed in Chriſt, but durſt not ſay ſo much openly of him, becauſe they loved the <hi>praiſe of men more than of God,</hi> and feared more to be caſt out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> then to be ſhut out of the kingdom of Heaven; this poore woman is not aſhamed of her Faith, ſhe publiſheth her beliefe, ſhee publiſheth it in her prayer unto Chriſt, which ſhe uttereth with a loud voyce, that all ſtanders-by might witneſſe, how highly ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him. A good patterne for us, to lay ſuch good ground of our faith in our prayer as this poore woman doth, and what our hearts believe, never to bee afraid to ſuffer our tongues to utter.</p>
               <p>But as this is imitable of us, ſo would a man thinke it ſhould have beene availeable with Chriſt; but it workes never a whit, hee anſwers never a word. Of God Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee cannot deny himſelfe:</hi> but Chriſt ſeemeth here by his ſilence, not to acknowledge that he is the man, that ſuch a worke can be done by him: he takes no notice
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8638:32"/>of her ſpeech, hee ſeemeth nothing moved with her words: Fleſh and bloud would not have rejected ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a title, and ſet light by ſuch a teſtimony as was given unto Chriſt by this woman. But Chriſt was not ſo ambitious. Nay rather, fleſh and bloud would have pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied and relieved, being ſought unto, and ſought unto in ſuch ſort as Chriſt was by the woman. But Chriſt ſeemes not ſo courteous, he anſwers not a word: though her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition were never ſo powerfull, yet it ſinkes not into him, not into Chriſt; but into the Diſciples of Chriſt it doth. But better never a whit, then never a whit the better for the woman. They are moved, and ſpeake to Chriſt; but it is to rid away the woman, but not to rid away the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill out of her child: they will not be troubled with her cry; but they have no pitty on her caſe. Chriſts ſilence was uncomfortable, but the Apoſtles ſpeech much more: for better they had held their peace then ſhewed themſelves ſuch Churles. They ſhould have made the womans caſe their owne and mediated for her unto Chriſt: but it is worth the marking, that before they were throughly ſchooled by the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and new formed by the Spirit of Chriſt: they are propoſed as patterns of naturall men, and expreſſe the infirmities of weak men: ſeldome ſhall yee find that they entreated Chriſt to doe good unto any, but they oftentimes move him for to hold his hands from doing good. <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are haſty to have fire from heaven to conſume the <hi>Samaritans;</hi> but they could not endure, that one that was not of their ranke, ſhould caſt out devils in the name of Chriſt. The Diſciples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them that would bring children unto Chriſt: they will not have CHRIST to feed them that followed him. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> diſlwadeth Chriſt from his Paſſion: they were but little better than ordinary men in the graces of Sanctification, though they had received many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts at the hand of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But our Inſtruction is that we muſt obſerve their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that wee doe not imitate it, and rather joyne our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8638:33"/>prayers with them that in their diſtreſſe ſeeke unto God, then to bee any hinderance unto them of ſpeeding with God. Yea and Chriſt Himſelfe though he doe little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the woman, yet doth he give a ſecret check unto his Diſciples: for giving them an anſwer, he ſhewes, that he was not weary of the womans cryes.</p>
               <p>But there was a better reaſon why he did not ſatisfie her requeſt, I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So that had ſhee beene a ſheep, though a loſt ſheep of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Chriſt would have endured her cry, and done as much as ſhe deſired.</p>
               <p>But you muſt marke, that whereas Chriſts ſilence might ſeeme to have imported that hee did not acknowledg thoſe titles, that office which the woman aſcribed unto him; in his anſwer, hee confeſſeth that hee is ſuch a one, and ſent for ſuch worke as the womans prayer doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe: but for all that ſhe cannot ſpeed, becauſe ſhee hath no part in him. So that Chriſts ſilence was more hopefull then is his anſwer. In his ſilence there was neither word nor deed for her; here are words, though no deeds; but words that make againſt her: ſo that better no anſwer then ſuch an anſwer, ſo uncomfortable an anſwer.</p>
               <p>Which imports, though Chriſt can, yet he may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her. To bee neere a helper, and to be denied helpe, hope of helpe deteined maketh miſery to be a double mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: for we are the better reſolved unto patience, when we ſee there is nothing that can ſuccour us. Here then is the womans blow given to her faith, able to quell it. The firſt ſeemed to be only contempt, but this goes farther, it cuts off all hope, and why? becauſe the woman is not a loſt ſheepe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Chriſt is ſent only unto them. So that whereas ſhe might have beene bold upon the matter, and the manner of her prayer; this ſhuttes her out for her particular, though it grant the truth of the matter, and the zeale of the woman in generall.</p>
               <p>But let us looke to the particulars of CHRISTS anſwer.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:8638:33"/>
               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> are compared unto Sheepe, and ſheep were cleane beaſts, ſuch as might be offered in Sacrifice, and be preſented in the Temple of God, and did yeeld a ſmell of ſweet favour and of reſt, as the Scripture ſpeakes. This is the prerogative of the Church, and this is the hope of them that are within the Church, that they are called into the fold of God, that they may come ſo neere him, that they may ſpeed in their prayers to him. This is not a favour vouchſafed unto all, no more then all beaſts be ſheep: the more ſhould the prerogative be eſteemed, and Gods mercy tendred. But we ſee ſheep will leeſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſheep, but loſt ſheep, two waies loſt ſheep: firſt by nature in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo all men were loſt; ſecondly by breach of Covenant, whereinto God entred with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and ſo they were in an eſpeciall ſort loſt: for whereas God was to be their God no otherwiſe then if they had continued his people, when they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed his law, either by ſeeking to other Gods, or uſing the ceremoniall Law amiſſe; they brake their covenant, and ſo loſt themſelves: notwithſtanding, as God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 31. <hi>God was contented to ſeeke them again, to enter into a new covenant with them, and to returne to the great ſhepherd of their ſoules.</hi> In this ſenſe doth Chriſt ſay, that he was ſent only to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was <hi>a Minister of the Circumciſion;</hi> ſo that preſſing this ſecond Covenant which reſpects loſt ſheep of the better ſort, he ſeemes to exclude the firſt ſort, thoſe that were loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi> So that he concludes mainly againſt the woman, that although ſhe were a ſheep, a loſt ſheep of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet if ſhe be not a loſt ſheep of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he can do nothing for her.</p>
               <p>You would think the woman would be anſwered, and give over upon this ſpeech of Chriſt: but the more ſhe is repulſed, the more ſhe preſſeth on him; and whereas her firſt prayer was repelled with Chriſts ſilent contempt and hopeleſſe anſwer, ſhe preſſeth on him upon her knees, and with her words, oppoſing geſture to geſture; the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8638:34"/>geſture of humility to the geſture of contempt; words to words, words of earneſt importunity to Chriſts words of a hopeleſſe anſwer: ſhe kneeles to him, ſhe ſpeakes to him, ſhe fawned upon him like a dogge, ſhe was inſtant with him to help her at a dead lift. So that if ye did before wonder at her cry ſo conſtantly profeſſing Chriſt, and her prayer ſo plainly expreſſing what induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhee had to ſeeke to Chriſt; now wonder much more at her geſture ſo humble, her words ſo importunate: ſhe doth more lively expreſſe her faith in Chriſt when ſhe worſhips him, then when ſhe did deſcribe him: and her cry is of greater force; when ſhe doth intimate that Chriſt doth uſe to helpe; but it is when he is importuned with a cry, for ſo ſignifies the Greeke word, which is as much as to runne at a cry. So that this ſecond cry is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the former, though it doth adde unto it: for ſhe doth really confeſſe him to be a Saviour, whom ſhe doth worſhip, for worſhip belongs only to a Saviour: and in that ſhe did worſhip him, ſhe implyeth notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing CHRISTS anſwer, that he was her Saviour; and He was to ſave her, becauſe ſhe called upon him.</p>
               <p>The leſſon that belongs to us is, that a true feare of <hi>God</hi> is not only verball, but reall; and that he proceeds in this feare that addes deeds to his words, and yeelds unto CHRIST in deeds what hee confeſſed to be his due in words.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That CHRIST will not helpe except we cry: for the proper word that ſignifies helpe implies that Gods mercy is to be obtained by our performance of our duty.</p>
               <p>You have ſeene this womans faith, her redoubted faith, ſtill the ſame, but not in the ſame degree; ſhe began well, ſhe goes on better, hoping that though Chriſt put her off with ſilence and with words; the firſt ſhewing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the ſecond cutting off all hope; yet he would be entreated, ſeeing that his denyall left ſtill ſome advantage unto her to reply unto him, and to gather that ſhe might
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8638:34"/>yet well hope to ſpeed well with him. But poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! ſhe hath not yet heard the worſt, her faith hath not had yet a full proofe: it was bad before, the next words will make her caſe worſe: the higher ſhe riſeth in faith, the leſſe Chriſt is ſeene to be moved with pity; for what faith he? It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to caſt it unto Whelps.</p>
               <p>Contempt is grievous unto fleſh and bloud, but yet if there be hope, it is better borne; but if no hope, and yet contempt, <hi>durus eſt hic ſermo,</hi> who can endure it? If you adde reproach to both, you muſt needs breake the I eart, a naturall man cannot but ſinke under it. Chriſts laſt ſpeech then is a moſt bitter ſpeech. It was enough not to reckon her for a ſheep; not ſo much a loſt ſheep, but to count her and call her a Whelp, this ſeemes more than enough: and a Whelp being in oppoſition to children, the compariſon encreaſeth the reproach, when others were ſo neere Chriſt, and ſhe ſo farre off from him. The phraſe alludes to uncleane beaſts: ſuch as had no acceſſe unto the Temple might not bee offered in ſacrifice. So that Chriſt now doth expreſſe plainly and fully, not only that he was not ſent unto her, but that ſhe was not in any ſort worthy to be reſpected by him. For as it is in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> above, the mother of us all, ſo it is likewiſe in <hi>Ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> below; <hi>extra canes,</hi> there is no place for dogs within it. So then, the woman may be gone, when her anſwer is ſo plain, that whatſoever goodneſſe is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it nothing concernes her, becauſe there is ſo little worth in her. But ſhe will not yet be gone, ſhe preſſeth yet nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Chriſt, and is more vile (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes) in her owne eyes: ſhe doth not ſtomacke the reproach, ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth her ſmall worth, ſhe confeſſeth that Chriſts words though they be bitter, are true, and that ſhe is no better than a Whelp: but yet though ſhe be of ſo meane worth, yet is ſhe not without hope, for ſhe hath one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage left, that ſhe hath ſome likelihood to ſpeed: for though ſhe be not <hi>a Child,</hi> but <hi>a dogge,</hi> yet may ſhe be <hi>fed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8638:35"/>with crummes;</hi> if not given unto her, yet <hi>falling from her masters Table.</hi> The humility was great in the prodigall child that ſaid, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee: I am no more worthy to bee called thy Sonne:</hi> make me but as one of thy hired ſervants. Greater in King <hi>David,</hi> who was not only contented to be a ſervant, ſo he might be a ſervant of God, but a ſervant in a meane place. <hi>I had rather bee a doore keeper in the houſe of the Lord, then to dwell in</hi> (as Lord of) <hi>the tents of the ungodly.</hi> But this woman goes beyond them: both ſhe is contented to be <hi>a Whelp,</hi> ſo ſhe may be <hi>Chriſts Whelp;</hi> and to <hi>gather crums,</hi> ſo it be from the <hi>Table of ſuch a Maſter;</hi> and the crums of that bread wherewith he feeds his children, though it fall from that Table whereat the Children ſit. It is no wonder, though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> counted all worldly things but dung in compariſon of that excellent knowledge which is in Chriſt; when this woman make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h ſo great account of the crums, that fall from that Table.</p>
               <p>What blame then doe we deſerve, that being accepted for children, and admitted to Chriſts owne Table, ſet ſo little by the childrens bread, when every crumme thereof is of ſo great worth? They that loathed Manna were ſharply puniſhed: how much more doe wee deſerve it, that make ſo little account of Gods mercy in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> This womans faith will one day riſe in judgment, and condemne us; that in eſteeming the gifts of God did go ſo farre beyond us, even ſo farre, that Chriſt may wonder at our unbeliefe, as he did at the <hi>Iewes,</hi> no leſſe then he did wonder at this womans faith, which was but a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile;</hi> wondred at it, and was conquered by it.</p>

They that are moſt unlikely, oftentimes prove moſt forward in the feare and ſervice of God. The cauſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is nothing elſe but the unreſiſtable operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which of ſtones can raiſe children unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when <hi>Abrahams</hi> childrens hearts are growne obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as ſtones.</p>
               <p>But let us come to the confeſſion of the <hi>Centurion;</hi> wherein you muſt mark who it is that ſpeakes, and what he ſpeaketh. Firſt who; it is a man of place, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart: of place, for he is a <hi>Centurion;</hi> of deſert, the <hi>Iewes</hi> witneſſe it, and prove it.</p>
               <p>Firſt for his place, he was a <hi>Centurion,</hi> a Captaine of an hundred Souldiers, had a charge, and a charge in that place: the Towne was held by a guarriſon, as moſt part of the Holy land was; being now in the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> though under them it was governed by a petty King. The note that we muſt gather is; that being of ſuch a nation, and put in truſt with a band of men in that City, his Country and his charge doe much augment the greatneſſe of his perſon, eſpecially in that place.</p>
               <p>Hee was then a great man and a good man too: the <hi>Jewes</hi> doe witneſſe it, and they doe ſeldome commend <hi>Gentiles;</hi> whom as they did uſually abhorre, as figured by uncleane beaſts, ſo did they uſually reproach by the name of ſinners: which you may perceive by the diſtinction of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8638:38"/>Saint <hi>Paul; are by nature Iewes, not ſinners of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> This commendation then given by the <hi>Iewes</hi> of a <hi>Gentile,</hi> maketh it probable that hee was no bad man, though he were a <hi>Gentile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Iewes</hi> doe not only witneſſe it, but prove it; and prove it firſt in that he loved their nation: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that he favoured their Religion. For the firſt, it is worth the noting, in a Captaine, and that a Roman Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that he was but civilly juſt, and did not oppreſſe them; whereas if ye looke but into the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ye ſhall ſee what manner of men they were, by <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> and by <hi>Feſtus.</hi> To ſay nothing of the Hiſtories of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> who notes how uſually they did prey upon the people, ſo that it was but a flattering ſpeech of <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Oratour, when hee ſo highly commended the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Deputy. This man then is proved by the <hi>Iewes</hi> to be good, in that he was not like to others in his ranke, in bribery and oppreſſion; but his goodneſſe reached fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he favoured their Religion, and had built them a Synagogue. A Synagogue was a place anſwerable to our Pariſh Churches, which after the captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> (for before there is no mention of them) ſeemed to have beene built in all Townes and Cities of the holy land, and elſe whereſoever the <hi>Jewes</hi> had their aboad, as you may perceive in the <hi>Acts;</hi> whither they repaired both to heare the Law read every Sabbath day, and to powre forth their prayers: ſo they looked toward the Temple, wherein, and wherein only Sacrifices were daily offered, which were inhibited in any other place, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were allowed for other parts of the worſhip of God. Now that this man ſhould build them a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, as it argueth that he was a wealthy man, ſo is it ſtrange that he ſhould do it being a Roman: for although from the time of the Babylonian captivity, the <hi>Iewes</hi> had beene under forraigne Kings, yet none of them favoured ſo little their Religion, as did the Romans. The Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> (as you may perceive by the booke of <hi>Ezra</hi> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8638:38"/>
                  <hi>Nehemias,</hi> and alſo the propheſie of <hi>Daniel</hi>) ſent preſents unto the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and made edicts for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the God of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> But as for the Romans, their Poets ſcoft at their Religion, their Hiſtories ſpeake reproachfully of it, their Emperours did vilifie it. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> commendeth his nephew <hi>Caius,</hi> for that paſſing into <hi>Syria,</hi> he did not put in by the way, and ſacrifice at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Their Souldiers ſtucke not to profane the Temple with their preſence, and ſacrilegiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rifle thoſe things that were dedicated unto God. Hereby you perceive, that it is a greater praiſe for this Centurion being a Roman, to favour the Iewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>He was then a great man, and he was a good man: and what would you now expect, but that hee ſhould ſtand upon his greatneſſe and his goodneſſe, and in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof, rather require then beſeech Chriſt? <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> when he came to be cured by <hi>Elizeus</hi> was highly diſpleaſed, for that the Prophet ſent him a meſſage, and came not himſelfe: I thought (ſaith he) he would have come downe to me, he would have ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, prayed unto his God, and layed his hands upon me: but becauſe he did not, the Captaine was departing in wrath. Lo here is the ſpirit of a Souldier, the ſpirit of a great man. Will you heare the ſpirit of a good man of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court? deſirous to ſpeed of his requeſt to <hi>Elias,</hi> he petitioneth him with a repetition of his good deeds. Hath not my Lord heard what thy ſervant hath done, when <hi>Iezabel</hi> ſlew the Prophets? how I hid an hundred of them in one Cave, and fifty in another Cave, and fed them with bread and water: behold the ſpirit of a good man. But our great man, our good man ſavoureth of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their ſpirits. You may perceave it by that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which he maketh of Chriſt: firſt of the eminency of his perſon, which he ſets forth partly by a compariſon of Chriſt and himſelfe, and partly by the Embaſſadge he ſent unto Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:8638:39"/>
               <p>But before we enter this firſt branch of his confeſſion; you muſt marke how he doth correct himſelfe, as if he had beene over bold with Chriſt. The firſt motion was, that Chriſt would come and cure his ſervant: but the ſecond is, that Chriſt ſhould not trouble himſelfe to come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not fit he ſhould take ſo much paines, for ſo meane a man. So that howſoever at the firſt he had ſome touch of his owne worth, yet his ſecond thoughts were more ſober, which brought forth this confeſſion of Chriſt; teaching us, that it is no ſhame to unſay what at any time we ſay amiſſe; and that we muſt lay aſide all conceipt of knowne greatneſſe and goodneſſe, when wee have a ſuite unto Chriſt, for he <hi>reſiſteth the proud, and will give his grace unto the humble and meeke.</hi> And of this <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> we may learne ſo to be humbled. But let us heare how hee eſteemeth the perſon of Chriſt, firſt comparing him to himſelfe, and comparing him in regard of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment into his houſe, and ſpeech from his mouth. I am not worthy (ſaith he) thou ſhouldſt come under the rooſe of my houſe. And Chriſt reports of himſelfe, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the birds of the aire had neſts, and foxes had holes; the Sonne of man had not an houſe to hide his head in: a meane houſe then in probability would not be refuſed by him, how much leſſe a <hi>Centurions</hi> houſe, the houſe of a man ſo wealthy, and of ſuch authority in that place? But yet whatſoever appearance there were in the outward ſhape of Chriſt, he apprehended ſome greater perſonage that dwelt in him: Even as <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſaluted the <hi>Virgin Mary, How commeth it about that the Mother of my Lord commeth unto me?</hi> Here was the Lord Himſelfe; and He might have <hi>Salomons</hi> conceipt, The Heaven of heavens cannot conteine him, and how homely a place then is this Temple, though a ſtately Temple, to receave him? And if the Temple were ſo unfit, much more muſt the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions</hi> houſe be, were it the beſt in all <hi>Capernaum.</hi> Wee muſt wonder at Gods goodneſſe that will ſtoope ſo low, as to accept of any place for his preſence here on earth,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8638:39"/>whoſe Majeſty is much impaired even in that revelation of himſelfe, which is in the moſt glorious heavens: hee cannot be diſcerned by the Creature, but in a degree farre inferiour to the infiniteneſſe of a Creator.</p>
               <p>That then which we muſt marke in this ſpeech of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> containes two profitable leſſons: the firſt is, that in that Chriſt took upon him the forme of a ſervant, we muſt not here hence grow to contempt of his perſon, but rather adore the goodneſſe of God; deſcending ſo low that he may doe good unto men, and in the depth of his Humility confeſſe the height of his glory. Secondly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with Chriſts preſence ſalvation will come to our houſe, as he told <hi>Zacheus,</hi> whereat we may well rejoyce, and which we ought much to deſire; yet is it meete alſo, that we have a ſenſe and conſcience of our owne unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and cry out with Saint <hi>Peter, Goe from me Lord, for I am a ſinfull man.</hi> So ſhall we give Chriſt his due, and confeſſe our owne deſart, and we ſhall be nothing farther from Chriſts mercy, though we be caſt downe before him in ſuch humility. This is the <hi>Centurions</hi> humility, who thought himſelfe unworthy that Chriſt ſhould come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the roofe of his houſe.</p>
               <p>But he is not content ſo to vilifie his houſe, hee doth much more vilifie himſelfe; for ſo he goes on, I thought not my ſelfe worthy to ſpeake unto thee. A ſtrange ſpeech of one of his place, of his worth! whoſe voyce was a commanding voice in that Towne, and Chriſt one of the meaneſt inhabitants of the Towne: a voyce that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Souldiers and Senators too, as you perceive by the Embaſſage: that ſuch a voyce, ſo commanding a voice ſhould not preſume, ſhould not be worthy to ſpeak unto, nay to petition ſo meane a man, and a man of ſo meane place within his charge! Ye would thinke theſe ſhould be the words of <hi>Abraham</hi> talking with God, and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe as being but duſt and aſhes, when he had a glimpſe of Gods preſence with him: but the <hi>Centurion</hi> confeſſeth him no better before Chriſt commeth neere
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8638:40"/>him. <hi>Iob</hi> layed his hand on his mouth after he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the <hi>Centurion</hi> before he ſpake. There was more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Majeſtie in Gods preſence to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but ſpecially to <hi>Job,</hi> then could any way be gathered by the outward ſtate of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So that the Humility of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> in not thinking himſelfe worthy to ſpeake unto Chriſt, doth import an excellent leſſon of reverence which is due unto God, and how great an impreſſion ſhould Chriſts Majeſty (as hee now ſitteth at the right hand of God) worke in us, when we pray unto him; when his ſtate in Humility was ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by this <hi>Centurion,</hi> that neither his greatneſſe nor his goodneſſe could imbolden him to adventure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by himſelfe to petition him. Our beſt devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commeth ſhort of this preparation: yet ſhould wee rather exceed it, then any way be inferior to it. The more we know Chriſts glory, the more humble we ſhould be in doing our duty. This is the firſt part of his confeſſion touching the eminency of CHRISTS perſon, ſo far as is expreſſed in the compariſon of CHRIST and himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be gathered alſo by the Embaſſage he ſends to Chriſt; an Embaſſage of the greateſt in the Towne, and the deareſt to himſelfe: he ſent the Elders of the <hi>Iewes</hi> at the firſt, and ſeconded them with the deareſt of his friends: <hi>Iewes</hi> he ſent, and ſo declined that which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man incurred, <hi>I am not ſent, but to the loſt ſheepe of Iſrael.</hi> He ſuppoſed Chriſt would gratifie the <hi>Jewes,</hi> though hee had no reſpect to him being a Gentile.</p>
               <p>But God had a further reach, to let theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the faith of the Gentile, and the relating of his words unto Chriſt, to give judgment againſt themſelves for their contempt of Chriſt; for ſeeing they were means (in the judgment of a heathen) meeteſt to prevaile with Chriſt, it was a ſhame for them not to acknowledge how much they were bound to Chriſt, that was not only good unto them, but alſo would be good unto the very heathen,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8638:40"/>to pleaſure them. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> have it attributed as an honour done by God unto them, for that God would heare <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and cure his family; and <hi>Iob</hi> for his friends, and forgive their ſinne. But theſe graceleſſe <hi>Iewes</hi> doe not eſteeme the favours of Chriſt, but rather ſeale their owne condemnation by the manifold proofe of his goodneſſe towards them. God doth this honour to all Chriſtians, to be <hi>their God, and the God of their ſeed,</hi> to bleſſe the children for the Parents. The more GODS mercy, the more our debt; and our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the greater, if our neglect do riſe with <hi>Gods</hi> mercy.</p>
               <p>But the Embaſſage as it was of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſo it was of the Elders of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> had there beene any greater, he would have made them his meanes: being for to ſend, he would ſend the beſt, becauſe he conceaved that the beſt were but too meane to be ſent unto Chriſt. It is the curſe that GOD pronounceth in <hi>Malachy</hi> againſt them that vowed unto God, and having a Male in the flock would offer a Female, or ſome contemptible thing; he gives the reaſon, becauſe I am a great God: and hath God a care of Sheep? or rather ſpeaketh be it not for men, that we muſt uſe the beſt of all ſorts, when we have to doe with God? And what wonder, when God ſent his owne Sonne unto man? Is there any perſon ſo great, that man ſhould think too great to ſend to God? there is none too great, none too deare. Chriſt as hee is the onely begotten Sonne of God, ſo is he the deerely beloved Son of his Father; and this Chriſt was ſent unto men.</p>
               <p>Anſwerably hereunto, doth this <hi>Centurion</hi> frame his Embaſſage unto CHRIST: hee ſendeth the greateſt and the deareſt he hath, he ſends the Elders of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and he ſends alſo his friends, that he might ſeeme not only to honour Chriſt in them that are great, but alſo to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect CHRIST in them that are deare: and indeed it is a compleat preſent for Chriſt, when we ſerve him with the beſt, and our beſt affection too; and our devotion both mature and alſo hearty, when both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8638:41"/>man are devoted unto him. And thus much of the <hi>Centurions</hi> confeſſion of the eminency of CHRISTS perſon.</p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond part of the confeſſion, which expreſſeth the efficacy of Chriſts power, wherein there are three things to be noted. Firſt, that he will not have Chriſt to trouble himſelfe, he meaneth unneceſſarily, as if his corporeall preſence were ſuperfluous; and in deſiring that, he ſhould wrong Chriſt, and not to the full expreſſe the ſtrength of his owne faith. So that this word is a retractation of his firſt deſire, which was, <hi>come and cure:</hi> but now he confeſſeth that the firſt is too much. <hi>Come</hi> is not requiſite to the cure. Behold the modeſty of the man that was little ambitious to have his houſe made a theatre of a miracle wrought with pompe and ſtate, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> preſents, and in a great aſſembly. Such thoughts were fit for <hi>Herod,</hi> who when Chriſt was ſent by Pilate to him, was glad, becauſe of long time he had deſired to ſee him; becauſe he hoped to ſatisfie his curious deſire, by ſeeing ſome ſtrange worke done by him. This <hi>Centurion</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends better, that Chriſt is farre from yeelding unto ſuch vanity: therfore that he may not ſeeme to affect it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with, Lord trouble not thy ſelf, and give us this good Item, that we muſt not intermingle the idle deſires of fleſh and blood, by deſiring any thing that is unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the hands of God. <hi>Come</hi> is unneceſſary, we muſt be contented with the <hi>Cure,</hi> and the Cure may be wrought with only, Speake the word.</p>
               <p>Here is the very object of his faith, even this word of Chriſt: or if you will, Chriſt the word: for the curing word is the word of the word, even the Word of God, which word is God, the word that in the beginning made all, and when it was loſt reſtored all. This word is that of which David ſpeaketh in the 107 Pſalme,

                  <hi>Serpent, but only the word that healeth all things:</hi> in reſpect of which vertue in Chriſt, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> obſerves out of the Prophet, that Chriſt <hi>tooke upon him all our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which by Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> appeareth, when <hi>hee cured all kind of diſeaſes;</hi> This word the <hi>Centurion</hi> would ſhape Chriſt to ſpeak, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calleth the word of Gods power, a word mighty in operation: and as it beareth up all things, ſo can it worke his pleaſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all things: it is a commanding word, and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands effectually, <hi>dixit &amp; factum eſt,</hi> hath an eternall truth. It is obſerved of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that when he had driven Pompey out of Italy, and ſeized upon the City of Rome, when hee would have entred into the Treaſury, a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Pompey would have hindred him: at whom <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8638:42"/>and doubteth not but the third point will follow, my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhall be whole.</p>
               <p>His ſervant (as it was ſaid before) was at the point of death: his caſe was deſperate in the judgment of man: <hi>Sed non eſt impoſſible apud Deum omne verbum,</hi> he did not doubt, but believing he ſhould ſee the glory of God: he doubted not, but that Chriſt could both raiſe from the dead, and preſerve alſo from death: and indeed had hee not ſo thought, that he could helpe where Phyſicke did faile, he would never have ſent unto him; he might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have beene of <hi>Naamans</hi> minde, who thought the waters of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> better than the water of <hi>Iordan,</hi> till he found that the vertue was in Gods word, and not in the water.</p>
               <p>But was all this for a ſervant? the meaner the perſon, the greater his humility. You wondred at that woman, but you have much more reaſon to wonder at this man: you have heard two ſpeciall reaſons.</p>
               <p>There is nothing reported of the womans either great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or goodneſſe, of this mans there is: ſhe confeſſed Chriſt, but it was in the out parts of <hi>Sidon;</hi> this man in the midſt of <hi>Capernaum:</hi> and whereas this woman did it, preſuming to come immediately to Chriſt her ſelfe; this man adventureth not ſo farre, but hee both uſeth the greateſt and the deareſt meanes hee hath. But now behold, whereas ſhe did both for her daughter, and her poſſeſſed with a Devill, a party ſo neere her, in a caſe ſo pittifull: this man humbleth himſelfe, and humbleth himſelfe ſo low, having no other ſute then for his ſervant, though a deare ſervant, yet but a ſervant, whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth in Greeke, as if he obſerved the Sonne of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachs</hi> rule: and a good ſervant was as deare unto him as his child: this ſomewhat amplifieth his vertue; and it amplifieth it the more, becauſe his ſervant was not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Devill, but almoſt exanimated with the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, a dangerous, but yet an ordinary diſeaſe; that could not in probability move a double, but a ſingle compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8638:42"/>the Devill poſſeſſeth not but with a double miſchiefe; the leſſe cauſe then there was why he ſhould be ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the greater is his vertue that he is ſo humble: but he teacheth us to meaſure our humility not by the greatneſſe of our ſute, but by his greatneſſe to whom we make our ſute, who is alwaies the ſame, though our wants may be of diverſe degrees. You have the Centurions confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: heare now Chriſts teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Chriſt confeſſeth it ſtrange, if you looke to the man, therefore Chriſt Himſelfe doth wonder at it. Chriſts wondring doth not ſuppoſe that beforehand he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it; but implies, that of this effect there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſmall outward cauſe. In which ſenſe he wondreth at the infidelity of the <hi>Iewes</hi> unbeliefe, on whom ſo many outward meanes wrought ſo little inward effect; for he could not match this faith, no not in all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet were there many worthy believers. But <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerveth well; it is leſſer wonder to heare a wiſe man ſpeak wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then to heare a plow man ſpeake but probably; for the leſſe is expected, the more is admired, if there come that from any man, which his meanes ſeeme not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor can inable him to performe. Howſoever ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there might be found a match in regard of the effect; yet if you looke to the cauſe, there was none ſuch to bee found, no not in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yea and the effect too went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the worthies that are recorded to have beleeved in <hi>Iſrael. Martha's</hi> faith was but this, <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt beene here, my brother had not dyed.</hi> She tyed Chriſts power to his corporall preſence. Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> at Chriſts word ventured to walk upon the waters, but he thought he ſhould ſinke, if he had not Chriſt by the hand. Yea, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had her, <hi>Quomodo hoc fiet?</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Angell told her, <hi>Non eſt impoſſible apud Deum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne verbum,</hi> ſhe made not that bleſſed Confeſſion, Behold the ſervant of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word. This man prevents all, he expects no promiſe, he doubts no diſtance of place, hee deſireth no touch of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8638:43"/>Chriſts hand, Trouble not thy ſelfe, Lord, ſaith hee, with any of theſe things, only ſpeake the word, and my ſervant ſhall be whole. Doth not Chriſt juſtly wonder at it in an heathen, when he could find no example for to match it in thoſe that were his choſen? A plaine prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication, that the Church of the Gentiles ſhould bee more renowned for faith than ever was the Church of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and that the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the faith, ſhould far excell his ſeed according to the fleſh, his faith was ſtrange, if you look to the man, but if you look to the matter, it was very true: the event did prove it; Chriſt ſpake the word, and his ſervant was made whole. Saint <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Chriſt takes no time, neither deſires op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of place; vertue goes from him more than can be diſcerned in him. Even when a cloud doth intercept the brightneſſe of the Sunne, a quickning influence inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly proceeds from him, which vegetateth the earth. Even a beame paſſed from Chriſt which cured that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Even Chriſt was not ſeene, and might ſeeme not to worke. Chriſt now ſitteth at the right hand of God, and yet wee muſt not doubt but hee is effectuall in his Church, as much to cure our ſoules, yea more than he was in curing that ſervants body; and this he doth only by his word; of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith well out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Say not in thine heart, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, that is, to bring Chriſt from above? or who ſhall deſcend into the duſt, that is, to bring Chriſt again from the dead? <hi>But what ſaith it?</hi> the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thine heart. This is the word of faith which we preach, whoſe effectuall power we ſhall feele, as many as doe believe.</p>
               <p>The upſhot of all is: Chriſt in this Hiſtory taxeth the <hi>Iewes</hi> for being ſo backeward in compariſon of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> in both eſteeming the perſon of Chriſt, and depending upon the power of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Their defect muſt be our admonition. King <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Abſolon</hi> was overthrowne, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> offered their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8638:43"/>ſervice, to bring their King home to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſtriving who ſhould bee forwardeſt, and condemning them that were ſlow, ſent this meſſage to <hi>Zadoc</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſts, ſaying; ſpeake unto the Elders of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and ſay, why are ye behind to bring the King again to his houſe? for the ſaying of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is come unto the King, even to his houſe. Ye are my brethren, my bones and my fleſh: Wherefore are yee then the laſt that bring the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? We are the peoples <hi>Abiathar</hi> and <hi>Zadoc:</hi> we in Gods name muſt blame the peoples coldneſſe, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And I pray God wee may have as good ſucceſſe with you as theſe Prieſts had with <hi>Iudah;</hi> for they bowed the hearts of all the men of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> as of one man, even with emulation againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for to ſhew their forwardneſſe to returne their King. I pray God we may ſo ſurpaſſe theſe Gentiles in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring Chriſt: ſo may we ſpeed in all our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, that in imitation of them, we ſhall ſo humbly, ſo faithfully preſent our ſelves unto CH<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Prophets and Apoſtles ſo ſerved God, that they ceaſed not to be men; they could not put off their natural affection, though they were moſt carefull to diſcharge their ſupernaturall Vocation: they were not without ſenſe, when they were meſſengers of Gods vengeance. Therefore bringing fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they would quench it with their owne teares; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing wrath from God, they would appeaſe it with their owne prayers: they will put their owne ſhoulders under the burden of the people: they were contented themſelves to be a curſe, for to diſcharge the people: in a word, they would then ſacrifice a contrite ſpirit of a repenting ſoule unto a mercifull God, when they were ſent with woes and lamentations unto graceleſſe ſinners
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8638:45"/>from an irefull Iudge. Thus <hi>Moſes, Samuel, David, Eſay, Paul</hi> and others propheſied and prayed: and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell; for Chriſt wept over <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> when he foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her imminent miſery. God himſelfe ſeemes to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in himſelfe, when for ſin he muſt correct his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity. So that men doe but imitate that gracious conflict of mercy and juſtice obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chriſt and God, when they intermingle their humble prayers with theſe heavie doomes which they pronounce againſt the world in the name of God: this fellow-feeling, theſe bowels of compaſſion, the ſweet compoſition of propheſies and prayers was in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ſo much the more frequent, by how much that anciently threatned Iudgement in his dayes more neerely approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the evils thereof were more clearely revealed; a taſt whereof we have in the firſt part of this Chapter, wherein he foretels and deſcribes ſuch a famine as ſhould afflict beaſts and men; poore and rich; not ſome, but all; as well in Country as in Towne: inſomuch that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and lowd complaints and groanes ſhould be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the dejected ſoules of that diſtreſſed people. This judgement as his tongue denounced it dreadfully, ſo his owne ſoule apprehended it feelingly, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay he ſtood up in the gap betweene God and his people, hee layed hold upon that hand wherewith God was ſtriking his people, and with ſpirituall incenſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured an attonement betweene God and his people, as appeares in theſe words that now I have read unto you. Wherein we may obſerve theſe two points: firſt <hi>Ieremy</hi> his confeſſion, ſecondly <hi>Ieremies</hi> ſupplication: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>O Lord, our ſinnes teſtifie againſt us,</hi> the ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>yet deale thou with us according to thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, of the Confeſſion. <hi>Our ſinnes.</hi> The word uſed by the Prophet doth ſignifie not barely ſin, but perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe coupled with ſinne, which much encreaſeth the hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe of ſinne. There are many ſorts of ſinne. Sinne of ignorance, and that is zeale without knowledge; when
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8638:45"/>we intend good, but erre in our choiſe of that which is good. In the heart of every man there are naturally prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion and honeſt converſation: but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions which we frame of thoſe principles doe make us many times to erre in Religion and ſwerve in converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The reaſon is, the blindneſſe of our underſtanding, whereby (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.)
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22.</note> 
                  <hi>when wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be moſt wiſe, we become the greater fooles:</hi> fooles in making of falſe rules, and fooles in being miſguided by them. The <hi>Iewes</hi> zealous for <hi>Moſes</hi> perſecuted <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but they neither drew true rules out of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> teacheth <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, 21.</note> neither did they diſcerne the Perſon of <hi>Christ,</hi> they were fooles in both. The ſame may be obſerved in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. there are two ſorts of ſinne, which is,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</note> ſinne of infirmity, when a man delighteth in the Law of God in the inner man, but he ſeeth a Law in his members rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the law of his mind &amp; carrying him captive unto ſinne; ſo that the good which he would he cannot doe, but the evill that he would not, that he doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15.</note> thus no man ſinneth but he ſorroweth, he laboureth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of ſinne, and receaveth no comfort untill he be releaſed of the guilt of ſinne. So <hi>Peter</hi> denyed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but he wept bitterly. <hi>David</hi> committed murder and adultery, but he repented heartily. <hi>Solomon</hi> fell into manifold vanities, but he confeſſed it all humbly. Beſides theſe two ſorts of ſinne there is a third, called ſinne of perverſnes, when men not of ignorance or infirmity, but wittingly and willingly deſpleaſe and deſpiſe God. The branches whereof are three, all by <hi>Ieremy</hi> noted in the <hi>Iewes:</hi> by conſideration whereof we muſt underſtand the ſin which was committed by the <hi>Iewes.</hi> The firſt branch is a rejection of Gods word; the ſecond, an abuſing of Gods gifts; the third, a ſenſeleſnes under Gods plagues. They rejected Gods word, for when God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded one thing, they would doe another: thus ſaid the Lord, <hi>ſtand in the way, behold and aske for the old way, which is the good
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8638:46"/>way, and walke therein, and ſo ſhall ye find reſt unto your ſoules: but they anſwered, we will not walke therein.</hi> Alſo God ſet over them watchmen which ſaid, <hi>take heede to the ſound of the Trumpet;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.17.</note> but they anſwered, wee will not take heed. Ier.</hi> 6. <hi>Nay they ſaid desperately, Surely wee will walke after our imaginations, and doe every man after the ſtubbornneſſe of our owne wicked heart.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12.</note> Ier.</hi> 18. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſheweth three notable experiences of this branch of ſtubbornneſſe. Firſt God ſaid, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> ſhould come againſt them, they ſaid, they would not come. Secondly, when they were come, GOD ſayd, they muſt yeeld; they ſaid, they would not yeeld. Thirdly, when they were conquered, God commanded the remnant not to goe downe into <hi>Egypt;</hi> but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God they would, and did goe downe to <hi>Egypt.</hi> Thus they tooke occaſion from the meſſages of God, to ſhew their overthwart dealing with God.</p>
               <p>A ſecond breach of their perverſneſſe was the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Gods gifts; which being beſtowed to worke and encreaſe a knowledge of God, to manifeſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the love of God, were uſed by them to obſcure his glory and impaire his feare; for they turned the truth of God into a lye, and ſerved the creature, ſorſaking the Creator. <hi>Have I beene as a wilderneſſe unto Jſrael, or a land of darkneſſe, ſaith God? wherefore ſaith my people, wee now are Lords, wee have enough, we will come no more at God. Can a maid forget her ornament, or a Bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me, which am their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and attire. O ye heavens, be aſtonied at this, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid and utterly confounded: for my people have committed two evills; they have forſaken me the fountaine of living waters, to dig them pits, even broken pits, which can hold no water.

               <p>The third branch of their perverſeneſſe, is an unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſenceleſneſſe under Gods plague: they were ſtricken, but they ſorrowed not; they were nigh conſumed, but they refuſed to receave correction: they made their faces harder then a ſtone, and refuſed to returne, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.

Conjoyning all theſe you may perceave their ſinne, which was a contempt of Gods word and abuſe of Gods gifts, and a ſenſeleſnes under Gods plagues. This is the ſinne <hi>Ieremy</hi> confeſſeth.</p>
               <p>A ſecond note is gathered from <hi>Ieremy's</hi> coupling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the people and acknowledging his owne ſinne with the peoples,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as if himſelfe had provoked GODS plagues, as the people. When the Publican and the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee went up to the Temple to pray; the Phariſee ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8638:47"/>him from the Publican, both in place and in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: in place, for he would not come neere him, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe more holy; nor pray like unto him, as fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no burthen of ſin. But it is not ſo with the Saints of God: they confeſſe as well their owne ſins as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unto God; even when they come ſhort of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe wherewith the people provoked God. Read the prayer of <hi>Daniel,</hi> of <hi>Nehemias</hi> and others. <hi>Jeremy</hi> therefore confeſſeth not the peoples ſinne, but his owne. The reaſon is threefold. Firſt, becauſe in this life, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt men are ſinfull men, and therefore ſhould be humble men, and have a feeling of that body of ſin whereunto they are ſubject, ſo long as they are mortall men. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Ieremy</hi> was a Prieſt, and therefore was to pray both for himſelfe and for the people, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth out of this Law in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a member of the ſame body both civill and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, he could not be without a fellow feeling of their imminent dangers. For as in our body naturall, though a wound be but in one part, the ſmart is in every part; and the danger that ſhould periſh one part is avoyded by the endeavour of every part: ſo is it in the body civill of the common weale, and Eccleſiaſticall of the Church: which note we muſt rather obſerve in <hi>Ieremy;</hi> becauſe hee was warranted that hee ſhould be ſecure, though the people periſhed; even as <hi>Moſes</hi> had an offer, that of him God would make a mighty people, if he could bee contented that God for ſinne ſhould deſtroy his people: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would endure it, and both prayed againſt it.</p>
               <p>A third note that is the property of ſinne; and that is the teſtifying of ſinne. Men are willing to commit ſin, and ready alſo to confeſſe their ſinne, like the Harlot in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> which committed adultery, <hi>wipes her mouth, and asketh what evill hath ſhe done:</hi> but it is in vaine. For <hi>God</hi> hath given a voyce to ſin, and the evidence that ſhall bee brought againſt us, and cannot be excepted againſt by us, is the evidence of ſin in ſin, beſides the act of ſin, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8638:47"/>quickly paſſeth. There are two evils, either of which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continueth, the ſtaine of ſin and the guilt: the ſtaine which cleaveth partly to the perſon committing ſinne, and partly to the creature abuſed in ſinne: to the perſon, for ſo the Scripture teacheth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.15.</note> Where <hi>God</hi> refuſeth the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſacrifice, becauſe their hands were full of bloud, not that they did ſhed, but before they had ſhed bloud, and in their hands God ſaw ſtaines of bloud. So <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of eyes full of adultery, that is, which are not only windowes to let in luſt, but alſo againſt GODS judgment day are the Regiſters of Luſt. In this ſence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of throats which are open Sepulchers, and tongues that are tipt with poyſon of Aſpes. In a word, no part of our body or ſoule, which records not the ſin that is committed either by our body, or our ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſtaine of ſinne cleaveth to the creature abuſed in ſinne: for <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.2, 7, 18.</note> the Idolatry of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is layd on the hornes of the Altars: and <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. God teacheth the peoples ſinne by the places where they committed ſinne. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes of graves of luſt, and waters of ſtrife, <hi>Iames</hi> of witneſſing, Ruſt of gold and ſilver and moths fretting our garments; which ſpeeches meane no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>hing elſe, but the ſtaine of ſinne abiding on the creature abuſed by ſin. And in this ſenſe ſin is ſaid to have a voyce, the voyce of ſinne being the meaſure of ſinne: ſmall ſins oft have ſoft voyces; the greater the ſinne, the louder it cries. Murther is a great ſinne, therefore a loud ſinne; luxury a great ſinne, and therefore a loud ſinne; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion a great ſinne, and therefore a loud ſin: not but that the eare of jealou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus much of the firſt part, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have heard the nature, the community and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He argument of this Pſalme is King <hi>Davids</hi> exemplary experience for the worlds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and Gods deliverance. The world doth envy them whom God doth honour, it perſecuteth them that rely upon him; but this is the comfort, that the event doth not anſwer, nay croſſeth their deſignes: their deſigne is deadly, but the event happie: Or if deadly, it is ſo to the wicked, not to the godly. In the godly it encreaſeth their confidence, dependancy upon God, which is never deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a ſeaoſnable deliverance from him. This King <hi>David</hi> affirmes upon his owne experience, in the firſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8638:50"/>part of this Pſalme, and in the ſecond deſires that it might be drawn into an example by others. He would have us in the like caſe to take the like courſe; to repaire to God, to truſt in him, not in any worldly perſon or thing; for all perſons, even the chiefe of all yeeld leſſe then no help, and great wealth, eſpecially if it be ill gotten wealth, is but a treaſure of nought; both perſons and things will faile, will hurt us. If any man, notwithſtanding K. <hi>Davids</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and counſell, doubt whom to truſt, God or the world, how to live, righteouſly or unrighteouſly; he may be, if he be not wilfull, reſolved throughly by the cloſe of this Pſalm, by thoſe words of my Text; he may be reſolved from an Author undeceaveable, by a witneſſe unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from God by King <hi>David, God ſpake once or twiſe, and King David heard him;</hi> from and by theſe, he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved what God is, and none but God; how he deales, and deales with all. God, and only God is powerfull, and which is ſtrange, the ſame God is mercifull: power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto God, and to thee ô Lord, mercy. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed combination of which Attributes in God is eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, if we conſider his government of the world, for he rewardeth every man according to his works. Lo then in a word, what is the ſubſtance of this text: it is true, it is cleare, God can, he will reckon with us all, and deale partially with none. The paraphraſe of the Text, to judge what is in God, by that which proceeds from him. We have warrant from Gods owne mouth, under the Teſt of K. <hi>David;</hi> witneſſing, that the Indifferency of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the evidence of his nature. The points to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered are two; the perſons from whom we take this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and the reſolution that we take from the perſons: the perſons two; the author, and the witnes: and the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution conſiſts of two parts, firſt what God is, ſecondly, how he deales with man. Firſt, Of the perſons, the firſt whereof is the Author: the Author is undeniable, for it is God. God ſpake.</p>
               <p>Between God and man the Apoſtle puts this difference,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8638:50"/>Let God be true, and every man a lyar: for man is but a meere man; man may deceave or be deceaved; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe are incident unto God, <hi>nec actu, nec potentiâ,</hi> God doth not, he cannot lie; God is not, he cannot bee deceaved. And no wonder, ſeeing he is not only the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of all truth, but alſo truth it ſelfe by nature. So that it is no more poſſible for falſehood to be at one with God, then for darkneſſe to conſort with light: both import a reall contradiction. Whereas the greateſt commendation of the beſt man is but this. They ſpeake in <hi>veritate mentis,</hi> without ſimulation, without equivocation or mentall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The praiſe due to God is, that hee ſpeakes in <hi>certitudine veritatis:</hi> no miſt, or fraud, or errour can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt his wiſdome or his holineſſe: his word is tryed to the uttermoſt, like ſilver, (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh) ſeven times tryed in the fire. What then is our leſſon? Surely this: we muſt not be aſhamed of <hi>Iulians</hi> ſcoffe; he deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Chriſtian beliefe, becauſe it had no other proofe, then, Thus ſaith the Lord. But <hi>Nazianzen</hi> replies well: they which allowed and captivated their judgment to a man, have no reaſon to accept againſt that which relyeth upon the authority of God, eſpecially ſeeing they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved principles of Philoſophy which were examinable by reaſon. But we credit only myſteries of Religion, wherto no approches can be made by the naturall wit of man. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, they build on a profeſſed ſcholar of the father of lies: and we on him whoſe ſtyle is, The Lord God of Truth.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion that ariſeth here-hence, is; God ſpake, or the Lord hath ſaid, muſt goe currant with us, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonſtrable Principle of our faith, and an incontrollable precept for our life: it muſt goe currant, if God ſpeake it, if he ſpeake but once; how much more, if (as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in my Text) he ſpeake once or twice?</p>
               <p>I will not trouble you with divers readings of theſe words, I take them as our Church doth read them, and read them as may be borne well by the originall. But touching the meaning of theſe words, there are diverſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8638:51"/>obſervations. For ſome take the words definitely, as if <hi>David</hi> meant preciſely twiſe: ſome indefinitely, as if by twiſe he meant often. And they that take them definitely, have not all the ſame conceipt. Referre them to the Creation and Redemption of man, in both which God really ſpake: that he was powerfull and mercifull to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon with and to reward man.

God preacheth the ſame power and mercy in both, wee may know that they are in him, by that which proceeds from him.

There are two voyces of God, the voyce of his Precepts, and the voyce of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: for what is contained in the Law, is applyed in the Prophets, and both ſay nothing, but that of his power and mercy we have as many monuments as there be lawes of God, and lives of men. Some are ſatisfied with none of theſe, but report an outward and inward voyce, that ſounds the one in the eare, the other in the Conſcience.

               <p>There remaines yet an expoſition more, and that is not an idle one. God ſpeakes ordinarily and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily; ordinarily in the Canon of the Scripture, by the Paſtors of his Church; extraordinarily, when in the diſtreſſes of his children hee vouchſafeth to be an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate remembrancer unto them of thoſe comforts, which are notwithſtanding in generall contained in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betweene them and him; not ſpeaking any new matter unknowne to them, but by ſpeaking immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly himſelfe, making the greater impreſſion in them. And this was uſuall untill the death of the Apoſtles. We have inſtances in the old and new Teſtament, of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary voice: it is needleſſe to ſpeake of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, my ſelfe am now an inſtance unto you:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 16 3, 24. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.4.</note> but of the extraordinary is that, <hi>Geneſis.</hi> 15. <hi>Feare not Abraham, I am thy buckler, and thy exceeding great reward.</hi> The like hath had <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 26. and <hi>Iacob.</hi> 28. In the new Teſtament, how many times did God appeare to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Acts?</hi> and memorable to this purpoſe is the anſwere, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee: my ſtrength is made perfect in weakenes. King David,</hi> deare unto God, and exerciſed under the croſſe might (nay it is plaine in the bookes of <hi>Samuel</hi> that he ſundry times did) heare this extraordinary voice. And though all other expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in themſelves are true; yet unto this place I take this laſt to be moſt apt. But howſoever in underſtanding theſe words you have heard great variety, and yet no contrariety, onely by laying them together, this wee learne, that they which underſtand them definitely by differing each from the other, and yet not thwarting one the other, teach us that the wordes are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood indefinitely, and once or twice is often, very often, many wayes and many times, if hee might worke us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes or at any time; the doubling of a ſpeech re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting us the ſame leſſon, as it doth teſtifie Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſo it doth intimate our infirmity. GOD doth not alter, and hee can hardly alter us. Wee have watery
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8638:52"/>memories and ſtony hearts. Gods word leaves little impreſſion in us in the one, and makes as little in the other. <hi>Eſay</hi> compares us unto <hi>weanelings, whom hee makes to underſtand the thinges that hee speaketh to them that are weaned and drawne from the breaſtes.</hi> Secondly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> compares us unto <hi>babes in capacity,</hi> when wee ſhould be men in time. So that wee muſt be fed with milke, when wee ſhould be fit for ſtronger meates. And thirdly hee tels the <hi>Galathians</hi> that they will goe backe againe into the wombe of the Church: that which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> wondred at, <hi>Can a man enter into his mothers belly, and be borne againe? Little children</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>of whom I am in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againe, till Chriſt Ieſus be formed in you.</hi> What wonder then, <hi>if Precept muſt be upon Precept, and line up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on line, here a little and there a little?</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> wrote a ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>to ſtirre us up to call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the words which were told us before, even twice before, by the prophets, and alſo by the Apostles.</hi> Neither doth it grieve Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to write the ſame things to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> and hee aſſures them, <hi>that for them it is a ſafe thing;</hi> for during this life God cannot ſpeak unto us as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſpirituall.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8638:52"/>becauſe wee are not quicke of hearing; and it is well, of we can ſay truly, as King <hi>David</hi> here doth, The Lord ſpake once or twice, and I heard. And ſo I come from the undeniable Author to the unchalengeable witneſſe.</p>
               <p>It is a grounded truth; the report caryeth weight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Worthineſſe of the Reporter. This report then muſt be of greater weight, becauſe the reporter is of ſo great worthineſſe; A man of God, yea a man after Gods own heart: A man of God, it is more than like that God would ſpeake with him; a man after Gods own heart, it is very unlikely that he would report what he heard not from God: the ſacredneſſe and ſanctity of his perſon, makes his witneſſe without exception, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our imitation. Adde hereunto, that he was now a King, at leaſt annointed to be a King, a renowned War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, yea a Conquerour of great poſſibilities, if not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions: yet doth ſuch a perſon ſo noble, ſo mighty, learn to deny to the world what is due to God; he reſts upon no power or mercy but his, he eſteemes himſelfe an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptant to God, and ſo he might expect his doome: and who of us may ſtop his eares, when King <hi>David</hi> openeth his? for rather doth not the ſame duty taught ſo many wayes, ſo many times, require that duty of us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of King <hi>David</hi> here is a paterne unto us?

               <p>God ſpeakes, that we may heare: heare my people, and I will ſpeake. And the Lord challengeth the <hi>Iowes,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came I, and there was no man?

                  </gap>ns let us come to the leſſon.</p>
               <p>The Leſſon conſiſts of two parts, 1. What God is,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8638:54"/>Secondly, How hee dealeth with us. GOD is both powerfull and alſo mercifull. To thee ô LORD, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and mercy. The words are to be underſtood excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for what King <hi>David</hi> denyed to all creatures, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to the Creator: and ſo are the attributes often li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to God only; as none good but God. <hi>Noah</hi> will eaſily acknowledge this truth. If we diſtinctly conſider of theſe attributes; firſt the power; and then the mercy: all that I will obſerve concerning the power may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to theſe two branches; God is mighty of himſelfe, and Almighty: Mighty of himſelfe, for power is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall unto God, it is but by gift in the creatures: therefore Gods power is abſolute and independant, the power of all creatures is limitted and dependant. I will make it plaine by reſemblances. The ſunne is the fountaine of light; the Moone hath light, but it is borrowed of the Sunne: there is water in the ſpring, and in the ſtreame; but the ſpring hath it of himſelfe, the ſtreame borrowes it of the ſpring: ſo is the juice in the branches, and in the root; but for this juice, the branches are beholden to the root, not the root to the branches. Hereupon it commeth to paſſe, that the Moone doth wexe and wane, as it hath more or leſſe influence from the Sunne: ſo is the ſtreame greater or leſſer, as it draweth more or leſſe water from the ſpring, and the branches fade or bud, as they are moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened from the root. But <hi>this difference</hi> we muſt take, that theſe reſemblances fit our purpoſe but in part, for God is <hi>Agens liberrimum:</hi> God can at his pleaſure increaſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, and withhold all power from his creatures: but ſo cannot the Sunne his light; the ſpring his water; the root his juice: therefore that power the creature hath, yet is not the creatures, but it is Gods: in him all things live and move and have their being,

<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Finally, our conſciences through feare will betray all the powers of our ſoule: every thing <hi>militat Deo:</hi> that is the ground of the ſpeech of <hi>Ioſhua;</hi> The <hi>Canaanites,</hi> though Giants and Inhabitants of high walled Cities, they are but bread; for we ſhall conquer them as eaſily as wee digeſt our meats: hee addes the reaſon; their ſhield is departed from them, the Lord is with us. You ſee then how true it is, that God is mighty of himſelfe; and every creature of it ſelfe hath no might, but a Tenant at will unto God, for ſo much, and ſo long as it pleaſeth him. But God as he is mighty, he is of himſelfe: and he is Almighty; nothing is impoſſible to God: hee doth whatſoever he will, both in heaven and earth: who hath reſiſted his will?</p>
               <p>But here we muſt note, that power noteth perfection, and imperfection no power, but want of power, and therefore wee muſt exclude imperfections; otherwiſe there be many things impoſſible for God. Imperfections are of two ſorts: onely miſerable, or blameable; and blameable, are the ignorance and ſinfulneſſe of men. God cannot be deceaved, nor can God ſinne: both are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Miſerable are all the puniſhments of ſinne; as ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and death: theſe are as farre from God, as ſin. But whatſoever things are of perfection, thoſe can be done of God: only in the perfections that are common to God with us, we muſt obſerve a great difference between God and us: for beſides that hee is Almighty, hee hath all his perfections of himſelfe, and we ours from him: he hath them immutably, he hath them eminently: he that plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our eare can heare, and he that made our eye can ſee. But he ſeeth and heareth without an eye and eare of fleſh: he is all eye, all eare: he ſees all, heares all. <hi>Enter, praeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8638:55"/>Deus eſt, &amp; ubique; potenter.</hi> His Majeſty fils Heaven and Earth. All things are naked before him; yea, there is nothing that is not ſuſtained by him. Though all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections be far from God, yet are they not without the compaſſe of the providence of God, he permitteth them, hee ordereth them, yea hee draweth his glory and his Churches good out of them. The ſame God that could command light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, can out of evill bring forth good. Yea Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath a good rule; God would never ſuffer evill, except he could make this uſe of evill.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing that we muſt note of this part is, that we muſt not limit Gods power, within the compaſſe of that which hath beene, is or ſhall bee: it hath a further extent, even to that alſo that may be. It was the error of <hi>Origen</hi> challenged by <hi>Theophilus,</hi> ſo to ſtraiten the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God: he exemplifieth it by the author of an houſe and a banquet, not according to the uttermoſt of his skill or ability, but according to the uſe whereunto He will put the houſe, and the number of the gueſts that ſhall be feaſted at his Table. The end preſcribes the meaſure and meanes in every worke of man, much more of God. But to collect all that hath beene ſaid of this firſt Attribute; whether we reſpect what God can doe, or what he doth; with perfection, or upon imperfections; without means or by means; of himſelfe, independant, having all things attending at his becke readily: we may conclude, that power belongeth unto the Lord; ſuch power only unto God. So that we may all ſet up the Enſigne of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees,</hi> and beare in our banners, <hi>MICHAEL,</hi> who is like unto thee, ô ſtrong Lord! In the feare of the Lord muſt be the confidence of our ſtrength, for his name is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous will flie unto it; yea, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners too may be bold to ſlie unto it; becauſe of that other Attribute which God hath coupled with it, His mercy. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The leſſon is, we muſt forbeare from wrong, and doe good unto our neighbour, that God may ſpare us, and do good unto us according to our workes.

                     <hi>Eſa</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.3.</note> What ſay we to that of the Papiſts commendations of Infidels workes? Surely, the worke is good, according to the judgment of man, and ſo hath the rewards that are ſo deemed of naturall men. So was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Iehu</hi> and others rewarded. But out of this Obſervation, that the mind, and not the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is rewarded, here ariſe two excellent points. The one is, that we muſt take the definition of a good worke from the Scripture. The end of the Commandement is Charity out of a pure heart and a good conſcience, and faith unfeigned. For God reſpecteth not ſo much <hi>opus operatum,</hi> as <hi>opus operantis:</hi> and when it is ſaid, <hi>ſecundum opus,</hi> it is taken with all his circumſtances: for <hi>ordinata</hi> and <hi>ſubordinata</hi> though they be not expreſſed, they are underſtood; otherwiſe we ſhall commit many abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in expounding the Scriptures. When the effects of Faith are given to Charity, to the feare of the Lord, to Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith muſt worke by Charity: and a worke <hi>tantum habet virtutis quantum fidei &amp; charitatis.</hi> It is Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> rule; <hi>Bonum opus, intentionem fides diſtinguit. Aug. praefat. ſp.</hi> 31. And this overthroweth all the workes, that are about merit, for the foundation of the reward is faith, which beares out all the defects of our conſcience and of Charity. The ſecond thing that this doth yeeld is, that all men herein are equalled, becauſe a man is accepted according to that which he hath, not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8638:57"/>according to that which hee hath not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to workes.</hi> We muſt looke immediately to our ſelves, and foreſee our conditions of reward or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: But we muſt not lay our foundation there, but goe higher, remembring that of God in <hi>Moſes, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta mea mihi,</hi> my lawes are for you. And ſeeing the other vertues are in the ſight only of God, and the works before the world: God that will judge in the ſight of the world, will judge according to works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reward. Hoc ipſum laborare mercedis loco habendum:</hi> it is an honour to doe ſo here by grace; for it is the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt we ſhall attaine unto in the ſtate of glory. For what is the greateſt reward of glory, but to ſtand by the throne and praiſe God? and it is our duty: yet no man ſhutts the doors of God in vaine. The ſervant muſt come with his talent, and enter into his maſters joy, or into utter darknes. <hi>Behold I come, and my reward is with me.</hi> Reward, <hi>Iſay</hi> 40.10, 62, 11.

Ordinarily God doth it in both: he ſuffereth not the ſinnes of his owne children unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor the rightneſſe of the heathen temporally unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded: hee keepeth eternall rewards of mercy for his children, and of plagues for his enemies. That God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth his children, read the ſtories of <hi>Moſes, David, Aaron:</hi> that he rewardeth ſee <hi>ſupra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he puniſheth his children, not taking his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie from them, but <hi>virga viri,</hi> which at the moſt can but kill the body; but not <hi>Dei,</hi> that caſts both body and ſoule into hell fire.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8638:60"/>ſpirit, which is vouchſafed them that ſit upon the ſeat of God. Mens cauſes are mutable, as are men, and receave manifold Sophiſtications by the cunning of men: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolution of them and judgment upon them, muſt proceed from men which can throughly ſound the nature of them; which is very hard for a meane naturall man: therefore doth God grant an extraordinary ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo to the ſeventie Aſſiſtants of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> to Princes, and to ſuch as are joyned in Commiſſion with Princes. It is true, that the leſſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> had of meanes naturall, the more they had of ſupernaturall: but no nation was ever ſo furniſhed with the naturall, but it had need of the ſupernaturall: and God never denyeth it, if men have grace to pray for it, if when they are called upon earth to ſupply the place of God, they become hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble petitioners with <hi>Salomon</hi> for wiſdome unto God. But of that which hath beene ſpoken, the nature and parts of the firſt defect, may be eaſily conceaved; Ignorance is oppoſite to government, and that Magiſtrate is ignorant which wanteth thoſe meanes, which he muſt have either from earth, or elſe from heaven.</p>
               <p>The ſecond defect is Negligence, they conſider not.

The ſumme of the ſecond defect is, that a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Magiſtrate, which cannot be eaſily recalled, muſt not bee raſhly pronounced: as God, ſo the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate muſt pronounce leiſurely, carefully, unaffectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, Otherwiſe hee is ignorant of the cauſe, and that willingly; and hee cannot excuſe himſelfe before God, if he judge unjuſtly.</p>
               <p>The third defect is want of conſcience, they walke on in darkeneſſe. Darkenes and light, as naturally, ſoe ſpiritually are oppoſed one to the other, and may bee conceaved the one by the other. Light naturally hath three properties; it is cleare, pure and pleaſant: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it noteth ſpiritually clearenes of underſtanding, purenes of converſation, and bleſſednes of condition: ſo contrariwiſe darkeneſſe hath three properties; natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8638:61"/>it is obſcure, impure and unpleaſant, and noteth ſpiritually obſcurenes of underſtanding, impureneſſe of converſation and curſednes of condition. Not to touch the other branches, unto this place I fit the ſecond, by darkeneſſe underſtanding ſinfulnes, for that ignorance was taxed in the firſt note, they underſtand not; and curſednes is an effect of all three defects. The middle ſenſe then agreeth beſt to the place; for wicked men are called Children of darkenes, their ſtate is a ſubjection to the prince of darkenes, and their deedes are called workes of darkenes. To walke is to proceed, not with feete, but with affections: for as the earth is the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle place, ſo our birth is the middle way betweene hell and heaven; and becauſe our ſoule is an active ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it never maketh a ſtand; we ever move on, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the broad way to hell, or the narrow way to heaven, <hi>Solomon</hi> teacheth it by a reſemblance; <hi>the way of righteous men is like the morning light, which ſhineth more and more untill the perfect day: but the way of the wicked is darkenes, like the evening twilight, that thicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more and more untill the midnight, that is, they goe on in darkeneſſe, untill they come to utter darkeneſſe.</hi> To walke on then in darkeneſſe is to proceed in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But becauſe Magiſtrates doe ſuſtaine a double per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; one as they are men, the other as they governe men; wee muſt conſider what is their eſpeciall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, not as they are men, but as they governe men. Governours, as the Scripture ſpeaketh, muſt be light of the eyes, breath of the noſtrills, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the hearts of the people. A good Magiſtrate muſt be a refuge againſt the wind, and as the ſhadow of a mighty rocke in a weary land, that is, the good of the land muſt be procured, and the evill removed by them. But had Magiſtrates are compared to nets and ſnares, which ſerve to enſnare and take the people; to bryars and thornes, which ſerve to ſpoile and fleece the people; to wolves and to lyons, which murder
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8638:61"/>and devoure the people. In a word, the three maine ſinnes, which the Scripture doth condemne in Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates bee, Firſt their wilineſſe, Secondly their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſnes, Thirdly their blood thirſtines. The ſumme then of the third defect is, that bad Magiſtrates, whoſe care ſhould bee to provide for the common weales happineſſe, are commonly ring-leaders unto the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wickednes, purpoſely, gladly and obſtinately, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over unto ſinfulneſſe. And this of the three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, the Magiſtrates ignorance, negligence, and want of conſcience. I come to the ſecond point.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond point opens the danger of the ſtate in theſe wordes, All the foundations of the land are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

The foundations of a land are thoſe things which doe eſtabliſh a land. In a Chriſtian Common weale the foundations are double; one as it is a Church of God, the other as it is a ſocietie of men.

               <p>The ſecond foundation is of the common weale,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and that is alſo three-fold: the perſon of the Prince, the execution of juſtice, and the care of the common good; the perſou of the Prince muſt be naturall. God by his Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> (Chap. 30.) promiſing to returne the captivity of Iacobs tents,

<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1.</note> is becauſe they were his bones and fleſh: there muſt be a naturall conjunction, where wee looke for a naturall affection. Grafts doe alter their ſtockes in nature; for ſweet fruite graft into a ſowre ſtocke, doth not yield fruit anſwerable to the ſowre juice which is naturall to the ſtocke. But it is not ſo in Policy: the Prince which is the ſtocke, will communicate the nature of his owne juice unto his people, which are to him as grafts. Our Chronicles (to ſeeke no further) record wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hereof in the ſundry alterations in this ſtate by Picts, and the Danes, the Saxons, and the French: yea although by counterfeit pedegrees they doe pretend themſelves to be naturall, yet when occaſion ſerves, they will betray themſelves to bee unnaturall. <hi>Herod</hi> burnt all the genealogies, thereby to recommend himſelfe for a naturall Iew. But <hi>Flavius Joſephus</hi> hiſtory is proofe enough, that hee is but at unnaturall Iew. Phyſitians teach that herbes and plants though they bee wild, yet if they bee naturall, are more wholeſome and <hi>Soverain</hi> then herbes and plants ſet by the Gardiner, which are cauſed by art, and therefore are unnaturall. Men muſt therefore take heed, leaſt with the fooliſh Iewes they bee come of the ſtocke of the Herodians, or cry out againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they will have no King but Caeſar.</p>
               <p>The ſecond foundation of a Common-wealth is execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgement. God by <hi>Eſay</hi> promiſing manifold bleſſings to the <hi>Iewes</hi> remembers this for one, that they ſhall be founded in righteouſneſſe, and be farre from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. <hi>Chap.</hi> 54. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that righteouſneſſe is an everlaſting foundation. Although the ſoule be in the body, yet is the ſoule the foundation of the body; for the members of our body are knit together by ſinewes and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8638:63"/>by ligaments, they are imbroydered with veines and with arteries, and they are covered with skin: but if the ſoule with naturall heate doe not foſter theſe united parts of the body, if with ſpirits I doe not ſtirre and move the body; corruption will quickly deface the goodly ſabricke of the body. Lawes are ſo many ligaments of the ſocieties of men, and good orders are as the veines and Arteries of the ſociety. The ſociety is as the skinne that covereth the goodly politicke body of men: but if the executing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate be wanting to this body, there cannot bee long continuance of body. Never any common-weale peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for want of lawes, their bane have beene the cold execution of their Lawes.</p>
               <p>The third foundation is the care of the common good. The Plow (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) maintaineth the Scepter; and where there is a continuall expence, there muſt be a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſupply. All rivers runne into the Sea, but all rivers muſt be nouriſhed by waters which do through the pores of the earth flow from the Sea. The husbandman neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects not to take care for his ſeed Corne, becauſe by means thereof he reapes a plentifull harveſt of Corne. In the booke of <hi>Iudges</hi> in a parable of Trees, good Magiſtrates are compared unto fig Trees, to Vines and to Olives; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as theſe Trees are painfully dreſſed, ſo by theſe trees the husbandman is plentifully refreſhed. But bad Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are reſembled unto brambles, becauſe how much juyce ſoever by them is ſucked, yet no fruit from them is gathered, yea they looke ſtill as though they were ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>The application is eaſie. God in the common-weale of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ordained the Sabboth and the yeere of Iubilee, to continue a proportion betweene his people, in regard of their liberty and wealth. The meaning of thoſe yeeres is not only ceremoniall, but alſo Morall; as in the body of a man, if any part exceed his due proportionable meaſure, it is monſtrous in it ſelfe, and dangerous to the whele; ſo it is in the Common-wealth. Cities muſt be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8638:63"/>maintained, the people muſt be imployed, a ſummary of wealth muſt be provided, if we deſire that the ſociety of the people, and Majeſty of the Prince be long continued. And thus much of the double foundation of a Chriſtian Common-weale.</p>
               <p>A ſecond note to be obſerved in this ſecond maine point is gathered out of this word <hi>All,</hi> for it importeth the communication of the ſeverall parts of this double foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> writes of the ſoure Cardinall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Prudence, Fortitude, Iuſtice, and temperance, that they are ſo knit together, that he which hath one hath all, and he which wanteth one wants all; Or as in the Vitall parts of the body, Liver, Lungs, the heart and the braines, he that enjoyeth one enjoyeth all; and he that periſheth one, periſheth all: ſo fareth it with the foundations of a Chriſtian Common-weale; they are chained ſo together, that they ſtand and fall together.</p>
               <p>A third note is gathered from the word moved, which argueth a great force in ſinne, when it prevailes againſt them, which are of greateſt judgment to diſcover ſinne, and greateſt power to repreſſe ſinne: ſinne beginneth commonly with the weakeſt: ſo it began not with <hi>Adam,</hi> but with <hi>Eve:</hi> but where it can be leaſt reſiſted, it may ſooneſt be corrected. If a private man be given to ſin, the Magiſtrate can eaſily bridle him from ſinne; but Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſins are moſt conſpicuous and dangerous, like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſharp and venemous, by which the whole body is ſpeedily infected and deſperately deſtroyed. When the weather or wind beates upon an houſe or a tree, well may it untile the houſe or overſhrowd the tree; but if the tree be well rooted, and the houſe well founded, the danger is eaſily recovered, both of the houſe, and of the Tree; it is not ſo, that either the root be looſed, or the foundation moved: the moving then of the foundations doth imply a deſperate ſtate of the whole building. The ſumme of the ſecond point is this: the Common-weale, that it may be continued, it muſt be eſtabliſhed, eſtabliſhed ſpiritually,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8638:64"/>and ſpiritually on GOD, CHRIST, and the HOLY GHOST; civilly, upon the perſon of a naturall Prince, the execution of wholeſome Law, and the care of common good: All which muſt bee conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for that by the ruine of one, the reſt are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered; and if all faulter, the common-Wealth is deſperately hazarded. And thus much of the ſecond point.</p>
               <p>The laſt note is the connexion of the firſt point with the ſecond, which connexion may be made two wayes: the firſt makes the dangers of the State to be the fruit of a bad Magiſtrate, and is framed thus. They underſtand not, they conſider not, they walke on in darkneſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the foundations of the land are moved: for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe cannot be without his effect. And it is <hi>Iehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phats</hi> ſpeech, as we reade in the ſecond booke of the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi> and the nine and twentieth Chapter, <hi>anſwerable to the ſeed will the harveſt be.</hi> You cannot overthrow a foundation, but by violence; and there can be no ſtability of the foundation if it be forced by violence. Magiſtrates vertues and vices keep no meane; their excellency bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a publike either bliſſe or curſe: for the eyes of all are upon them, the lives of all are conformed to them, and the ſtate of all dependeth on them. This is the reaſon, when vertues are ſo earneſtly commended in them, and honoured in them, why they are ſo commonly dehorted from vice, and cenſured for vice.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Collection muſt be framed thus, <hi>They conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, &amp;c.</hi> and yet behold, <hi>all the foundations of the land are moved,

               <p>You have heard what is the Record. Now heare, that it is authenticall. God himſelfe will teach them. The buſineſſes of the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> were either <hi>Juris</hi> or <hi>facti.</hi> In matters of Fact which were doubtfull, either in peace or warre, they had immediate reſolution from God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Prophets that attended them, or by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> before the Arke.

                  </gap>, as <hi>Baſil</hi> well obſerveth. The Miniſter is but as the <hi>gnomon</hi> of a dyall, that onely points out the motion of the heavens. It is as lawfull for the Prince to prove the ſpirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets as to try his Dyall, whether it goe right or wrong. But the Biſhop of Rome conceipts ſo much of his Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that hee reſembles him in <hi>Pliny,</hi> who finding a diſproportion betweene the Diall and the Sunnes moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thought ſurely the earth was moved from his centre, or the Sunne had taken a new courſe, but ſuſpected not that the Dyall had beene ſhaken with an earthquake: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo they will permit Princes to meddle with matters in the Church, but directed by the ſupreme paſtor; on

               <p>But this place may intimate an extraordinary Spirit of Wiſdome which God vouchſafeth Kings; whereunto the phraſe reſpecteth, <hi>My Lord the King is as an Angell of God, knowing good and evill:</hi> Which <hi>Salomon</hi> prayeth for.

                  </gap>, as if there were a ſpeciall wiſedome that doth aſſiſt the thrones of Princes. And in regard hereof it was, that <hi>Salomon</hi> elſewhere deſires <hi>a docile heart,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>that the Kings heart is in the hands of God, as the River of waters; he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them whereſoever it pleaſeth him.</hi> Which one wittily expoundeth. All the fruitfulneſſe of a land, as alſo the barrenneſſe depends upon thoſe ſtreames of wiſdome; which God either ſends abroad, or withholdeth, by the heart of the King.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion of this point is. <hi>If yee delight in thrones and Scepters, ô Kings of the people,
<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>You have heard the promiſe that GOD makes the King; but yee have heard it only in the type. I ſhould (if the time would ſerve) ſpeake ſomething of the truth, ſeeing the truth concernes that King, and all Kings as well as the type. The Truth is Chriſt, whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth <hi>David,</hi> and the Sonne of <hi>David.</hi> God ſwore to him, and for him: to him as the head; for him, as that head is myſtically joyned to the body of his Church. He was born to be a King, and to make all his, Kings unto God: but not Kings, except they were Prieſts, and did ſacrifice themſelves unto God. If they were a Royall Prieſthood, then were they to ſit upon the Throne of the myſticall <hi>David. To him that overcommeth</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, as I overcame, and ſit with my Father in his Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the time will not give me leave to wade further in that myſtery. Only this I adde: that if you ſeparate
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8638:75"/>the Ceremoniall from the Morall, what was ſpoken to <hi>David</hi> concerneth every Chriſtian King: they have the ſame charge of keeping Gods Covenant: and they have no leſſe the ſame hope of ſucceſſion in their Crownes. For as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which tread the ſteps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are in the Goſpell ſaid to be the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of faithfull men; even ſo Kings which doe the workes of <hi>David,</hi> are the Royall off-ſpring of <hi>David, David</hi> the father of faithfull Kings: which is the cauſe why our Church on thoſe dayes which we ſolemnize in remembrance of the favours vouchſafed unto our Kings, doth uſe the Pſalmes that were penned for <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of all is. God promiſeth, he warranteth ſincerely and conſtantly unto Kings in a King, for their ſeed; Not only for themſelves: that if they forſake not him, hee will never deſtitute them, but continue their Royall line, Monarchs in earth, and Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Give then thy judgments to our King, ô God, and thy Righteouſneſſe to the Kings Sonne; That keeping thy Teſtimonies, they may abide in thy Covenant. So ſhalt thou make good unto them the holy things of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and other Princes that are faithfull; A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſucceſſion of this Crown on earth, and a bleſſed joynt poſſeſſion of a better Crowne in heaven. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL men are forbidden to ſinne, by the Law of the Creation: but they which in the Church are by Sacraments conſecrated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, have moreover bound themſelves from ſin by a religious ſtipulation. For a Sacrament conſiſts of a viſible ſigne, and an inviſible grace. Of which the ſigne repreſents not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what God offers, but alſo what man vowes: and the grace worketh no leſſe a conſcience of mans duty, then it doth a ſenſe of Gods mercy. Adde hereunto, that by Chriſts Inſtitution theſe two are ſubordinate, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne ſeemeth to make the way more paſſable for the inward grace. Strange then it is that any ſhould affect
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8638:76"/>the ſigne, and neglect the grace; yea boaſt of Gods ſeale and neglect his ſpirit. Not only ſo, but even preſume to ſinne upon warrant of that which containes ſo manifold a prohibition of ſinne; yet ſome ſuch Corinthians there were. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this Chapter taxeth them and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good this point of Divinity againſt them. Sacraments are no priviledges, either for ſinne, or from plagues. And becauſe in Morals, Examples are moſt working proofes; hee tryeth the Corinthians caſe by the Hiſtories of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> The effect of this Argument is this, <hi>God is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter of perſons;</hi> no more of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> then he was of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> And why? theſe two particular Churches are ſimilary parts of that whole one; which is Catholike both in time and place. Though in ſome other things they differ, yet in ſubſtance they agree. God in his mercy is equally neere to both, and in his Iuſtice will deale indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently with both. Therefore the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſtories are the <hi>Gentiles</hi> types, types not of Ceremoniall preſignificancie, but of morall correſpondency: by them they may judge in what termes their perſons ſtand with God, and what their deeds may expect at the hands of God. The <hi>Iewer</hi> were as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are, Sacramentally ſanctified, yet they ſinned and were plagued. <hi>Alterius caſus, alterius cautela,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, <hi>lib</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 56. The <hi>Iewes</hi> harmes muſt make the <hi>Gentiles</hi> beware. Therefore whatſoever he be, <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> that thinkes he ſtands, let him take heed leaſt he fall, as the Apoſtle concludes in theſe words that now I have read unto you.</p>
               <p>Theſe words then are a concluſion ſpringing from that proofe, which the Apoſtle grounded upon the example of the <hi>Iewes</hi> Wherein it is cleare, that Sacramentall ſanctification doth neither exclude ſin, nor exempt from wrath.

Yea if he ſtirre it not in greene wood, it will goe cleane out. Therefore as when God kindled fire from heaven upon the Altar, he commanded the <hi>Levites</hi> carefully to attend it, and imploy it: ſo muſt we entertaine the grace of God, that from Heaven is kindled in our ſoule, we muſt blow it and cheriſh it. God kindled that fire <hi>[Intendamus medijs non ſolliciti de fine]</hi> fire from Heaven; but he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men to cheriſh it on earth.

               <p>The ſecond point wherein they are anſwerable is the Arke <hi>Noah</hi> built, even the figure of our Baptiſme as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, Or of the Church whereinto we are recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Baptiſme. For the Arke was built according to the dimenſions of the body of a man to figure the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call man. I meane the Church, which is the body of Chriſt. Out of the Arke could there be no ſalvation cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, no more can there be out of this Church ſalvation ſpirituall. But we muſt heed the confounding of the true Arke with Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſhippe. The Catholike Church with that Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the priviledg of the whole Church, and the true Church, they appropriate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being but a part, and but the worſt part. Finally, the ſame floud that drowned the world, did beare up <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, and the ſame fire that ſhall conſume the world, ſhall make the Church of God more glorious, more illuſtrious, as gold is in the fire, of a different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from ſtubble. This was figured by <hi>Moſes</hi> buſh, and you had a taſt of it in the fierie furnace, the flames where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conſumed them that threw in the three Children, but could not ſinge their haire or clothes, that lived and walked in the midſt of it: you ſee ſome reaſon of the compariſon drawne from Noah and Chriſt, the Arke and the Church, the ſloud and the fire. But wee muſt take a more generall leſſon that is inſinuated in the compariſon, which is, that God in all judgements paſt gives us a fore-taſt of his judgements that are to come. So doth Saint <hi>Iude</hi> ſend men unto Angels.

Come wee now to the proportion of the parts: a double proportion of correſpondencie and inequalitie. Firſt, of the correſpondencie; the correſpondencie is double, as the perſons are of two ſorts, bad and good.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8638:87"/>In regard of the bad, the ſtory doth note the worlds wickedneſſe and ſenſeleſneſſe: their wickednes; <hi>for after that the ſonnes of God, had matched with the daughters of men, of them ſprang Gyants: notorious outragious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes.

But now in deedes: to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee that could not perſwade them to walke holily, could ſtrike a terror in them by building of the Arke: A viſible propheſie of the flood, to turne unto God peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently.

Thus it fared with the old world in regard of thoſe perſons that were bad: and is it any better with our world? In this Chapter Chriſt parallels the Iewes with this world, their deſtruction with the deſtruction of the whole, and the cauſe of their deſtruction even ſin and ſenſeleſneſſe, hee propoſeth as a looking glaſſe for all: how wicked they were, you may reade in the firſt of <hi>Eſay, from the Crowne of the head to the ſole of the foote, nothing but ſores and blaines,</hi> he meanes not corporall but ſpirituall, as you may read in the verſe going before thoſe words, where he cals them corrupt children and ſeed of the wicked. In the ſame Chapter he deſcribes their ſenſelesneſſe ſhewing that God gave over fatherly to correct them, becauſe the more they were ſmitten, the more they did apoſtatize from him. <hi>Ieremy</hi> doth ſpeake of the like generall ſinfulneſſe and ſenſelesneſſe, but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the latter end of the booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> and of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> it is amplified as the juſt cauſe of their Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian captivity, even when they were beſieged, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And indeed this world muſt anſwer that other world; it muſt needs be, that they which will not neither be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed nor forewarned, muſt be ſurprized. Our Saviour Chriſt expreſſeth it in three fine ſimilies. The firſt is of the travell of a woman, <hi>ſo ſhall the judgement day come.</hi> Every wicked man hath a double travell; Saint <hi>James</hi> teacheth it in his firſt chapter, <hi>Luſt conceives, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth ſinne:</hi> that is a pleaſant travell. But this wombe reſteth not here; for ſinne will not leave till it have brought forth death: that is a painfull travell, but an unexpected childe: when a man is not delivered of that which he conceived, his iſſue is death, when he at leaſt expected a contented life. But ſo doth God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a ſinner: even as <hi>Iob</hi> alſo reſembling ſinne to ſweet meat in the mouth, ſhewes that it proves the gall of Aſpes in the ſtomacke.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſimile, is of a Theefe; whereunto Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth the judgement day: not only to expreſſe his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected coming, but the event of his judgement, which will rob us of all that wherein we ſet our wicked hearts delight: you read it in the parable of the man whoſe ground bearing plenty, he was to inlarge his barnes, but he addes his wicked affection, groveling upon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things; when he encourageth his ſoule to eat and drinke, becauſe it had proviſion for many yeeres; but the Oracle checkes him, <hi>Thou foole, this night ſhall they take thy ſoule from thee; then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be? Dives,</hi> for all his ſoft raiment and delicate fare, had nothing left him when he was ſummoned by death to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8638:89"/>ſhroud him from, or refreſh him in the flames of hell.</p>
               <p>The third ſimile, is of the ſnare of a Fowler or a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which taketh the beaſt, or the bird; who catching after the pray, is caught by the engine: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that in committing ſinne, we doe receive the ſting of death. The condition of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne attends the ſinne of every ſonne of <hi>Adam:</hi> whiles eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, he looked to have eyes open, that he might behold himſelfe as a God: he found indeed how he was circumvented by the equivocation of the phraſe: that to be a god knowing good and evill, is but a periphraſis of the devill, and indeed he became unexpectedly, but juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a god like unto him, and ſo ſhall all his ſonnes that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly tranſgreſſe Gods lawes; heare that dreadfull voyce, <hi>Goe ye curſed into everlaſting fire, provided for the Divell and his angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have heard the proportion of correſpondency ſo farre as it concernes the bad; now muſt you heare it ſo farre as it concernes the good; for though the world were ſo ſinfull and ſo ſenceleſſe, yet was there a <hi>Noah</hi> left, and his family: but one <hi>Noah,</hi> and one family.

You have heard that there was a <hi>Noah,</hi> but marke that there was but one <hi>Noah</hi> and his family; a ſmall number to a whole world, but ſuch is the exceſſe of the wicked above the good: ſo many more are there that periſh, then thoſe that are ſaved: twas ſo in the old world, ſo it ſhall be in this: to follow the parable of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> but a remnant of the <hi>Iewes</hi> are ſaved. The Prophet compares it to a glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a vintage, or a harveſt. Whereas the wicked are compared unto the ſtarres of heaven, and to the ſands of the Sea, and to a whole harveſt. This is meant by the parable of Gods chooſing; but one tree of all the forreſt, one Dove of all the birds, one Citie of all the world: but conſider that there is one, though there be but one; for God will ſave a flocke, though it be but a little flocke: for the elects ſake he will haſten his judgement, leſt there ſhould remaine no fleſh to be ſaved. The world little thinkes upon that which is a grounded truth, that for the godlies ſake God forbeares to come to judgement. But in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. it is ſet downe plainly, when the ſoules that lay, under the Altar cryed unto God, ſaying, <hi>How long Lor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is fully built, the body of Chriſt hath all his members, and the true Olive hath all his branches.

               <p>The firſt is, That world was deſtroyed with water; this ſhall be deſtroyed with fire; and who knoweth not how much more terrible fire is then water?</p>

God therefore at that time was pleaſed to trie alſo this meanes, and preſerved not onely a <hi>Sem,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Cham.</hi> But in this laſt deſtruction God ſaveth not ſo much as one <hi>Cham,</hi> not a goate left among the ſheepe, if there be but one that wanteth his wedding garment, the maſter of the feaſt will eſpie him, and away with him, the corne will be cleane vnmowed from the Chaffe, and the gold purified from all droſſe. Adde hereunto the laſt point, that deſtruction was but temporall, this finall, that that was but temporall, ſo ſome underſtand. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 4. but this is undoubtedly eternall, for the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is, <hi>Goe ye curſed into everlaſting fire:</hi> no recall of the ſentence, no recoverie of the ſtate: ſo <hi>Noah</hi> ſaved, to be the hope of the ſecond world, as the booke of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſpeaks Chap. 14. You have here the inequalitie in regard of the bad, and in regard of the good, there is the ſame inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity alſo that fire ſhall as wonderfully preſerve them, as it fearfully deſtroyes the wicked. There ſhall be a generall renovation of heaven and earth, wherein dwels righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as there was a combuſtion of the other, heaven and earth wherein dwelt wickedneſſe. And in this heaven and earth ſhall be no uncleane thing, and that which is purified ſhall remaine ſo for ever, even bleſſed for ever,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8638:91"/>intirely and eternally bleſſed, whereas the deliverance by <hi>Noah</hi> was but temporall, it was but partiall, it was from a death but onely of the body, and that onely for a time, and that to live a mortall life, ſo that is, and ſo muſt have his deſtruction, that in that example, we read that God is diſpleaſed with ſinne, that he powreth forth his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon ſinne, but how farre he is diſpleaſed, how much vengeance ſhall be exacted, we may geſſe it in the former world, but we cannot throughly underſtand, that correſpondency doth not amount unto an equalitie. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a cloſe of all, he that readeth that, may well believe this: becauſe that is a pledge of this, and our beſt courſe is to follow Chriſts counſell. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. <hi>Take heed least at any time your heartes be oppreſſed with ſurfetting and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes, and that day come upon you unawares.</hi> For as a ſnare ſhall it come upon all the inhabitants of this world. Let us watch therefore and pray that we may be worthy to eſcape the things that then ſhall come, and ſtand before the ſonne of man: for as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo ſhall it be at the comming of the Sonne of man.</p>
               <p>Grant gracious Lord, that denying all ungodlines and worldly luſts, we may ſo reverence thy word and depend on thy promiſe with ſuch a confidence, that we be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinfull nor ſenſeleſſe, and ſo ſurpriſed with thy juſt wrath; but may watchfully looke for, and earneſtly haſten unto the bleſſed appearing of our glorious Iudge and Saviour, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
